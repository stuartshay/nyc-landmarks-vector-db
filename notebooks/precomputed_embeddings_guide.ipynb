    "## 2. Understanding Pre-computed Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Pre-computed Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-computed embeddings are vector representations of text (or other data) that have been generated in advance and stored for later use. In the context of our NYC Landmarks project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text → Vector**: Each piece of text (description of a landmark, historical information, etc.) is converted into a vector (list of floating-point numbers) using an embedding model like OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002.\n",
    "- **Storage**: These vectors are stored in a vector database (Pinecone) for efficient similarity search.\n",
    "- **Retrieval**: When a query is made, we find the most similar vectors to the query's vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Pre-computed Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance**: Generating embeddings is computationally expensive and time-consuming. Pre-computing them allows for faster query responses.\n",
    "2. **Cost Efficiency**: API calls to embedding models (like OpenAI) cost money. Generating embeddings once and reusing them reduces costs.\n",
    "3. **Consistency**: Ensures consistent vector representations across multiple queries.\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: Enables handling large datasets with minimal query-time overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we generate embeddings in our project:"

    "1. **Vector Storage**: When you upload vectors to Pinecone, they are stored in their original form (pre-computed).\n",
    "   - Each vector is associated with a unique ID\n",
    "   - Metadata can be attached to each vector\n",
    "   - The dimensionality of all vectors must be consistent\n",

    "2. **Indexing**: Pinecone builds specialized indexes to enable fast similarity search:\n",
    "   - Vectors are organized into clusters based on similarity\n",
    "   - Various indexing algorithms (e.g., HNSW - Hierarchical Navigable Small World) are used to optimize search\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Querying**: When you search, Pinecone compares your query vector to stored vectors:\n",
    "   - Similarity is typically measured using cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product\n",
    "   - Results are returned as vectors and their IDs, sorted by similarity score\n",

    "## 6. How Pinecone Handles Similarity Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Pinecone uses Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) algorithms to efficiently search through large vector spaces. Let's understand this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Exact nearest neighbor search becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of vectors grows. ANN algorithms trade perfect accuracy for massive performance gains:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Indexing Structures**: Vectors are organized into specialized data structures\n",
    "2. **Pruning**: Large portions of the vector space can be eliminated from search\n",
    "3. **Approximation**: Results are very close to the exact nearest neighbors, but found much faster\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Pinecone's Search Process\n",
    "\n",
    "When you query Pinecone with a vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The query vector is compared to a subset of the stored vectors\n",
    "2. The most similar vectors are identified\n",
    "3. Results are returned sorted by similarity score\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, Pinecone only compares your query vector to the pre-computed vectors it stores. It doesn't modify or re-compute these vectors during the search process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Trade-offs in Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy vs. Speed**: Higher accuracy requires more comparisons, which takes more time\n",
    "- **Index Size vs. Query Speed**: More complex indexes are faster for queries but use more memory\n",
    "- **Batch Size vs. Latency**: Larger batches are more efficient but increase latency"
