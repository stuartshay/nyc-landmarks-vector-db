# Active Context

## Current Focus

We're currently working on fixing issues related to PR #194 in the nyc-landmarks-vector-db project, which involves deploying monitoring infrastructure for the vector database using Terraform.

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Resource Conflict Errors**:

   - When running `./infrastructure/deploy_dashboard.sh apply`, we encounter "Error 409: Resource already exists" errors for the following resources:
     - Logging metrics (requests, errors, latency, validation_warnings)
     - Cloud Scheduler job (nyc-landmarks-health-check)

1. **Dashboard Configuration Issues**:

   - The dashboard template had issues with the pie chart configuration, causing deployment errors.

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Dashboard Template Fix**:

   - Fixed the JSON structure in `dashboard.json.tpl` to ensure proper aggregation configuration for all charts, particularly the pie chart.
   - Ensured the template uses variable interpolation for log name prefixes.

1. **Terraform Resource Management**:

   - Created `terraform.tfvars` file with proper project configuration.
   - Created two new deployment scripts to manage the existing resources properly:
     - `import_existing_resources.sh`: A script to import existing GCP resources into Terraform state
     - `deploy_dashboard_only.sh`: A script to deploy only the dashboard without affecting other resources

### Deployment Strategy

The project now has three deployment options:

1. **Full Deployment with Resource Import** (for initial setup):

   ```bash
   ./infrastructure/import_existing_resources.sh
   ./infrastructure/deploy_dashboard.sh apply
   ```

1. **Dashboard-Only Deployment** (for updates to just the dashboard):

   ```bash
   ./infrastructure/deploy_dashboard_only.sh apply
   ```

1. **Standard Deployment** (after resources have been imported):

   ```bash
   ./infrastructure/deploy_dashboard.sh apply
   ```

## Recent Progress

- Successfully fixed the dashboard template JSON structure
- Created and verified a working `terraform.tfvars` file
- Implemented targeted deployment approach to update only the dashboard
- Created utility scripts to manage resource conflicts
- Successfully deployed the monitoring dashboard to GCP

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation Updates**:

   - Create documentation about the monitoring setup and usage
   - Document the deployment scripts and their specific use cases

1. **Terraform State Management**:

   - Consider implementing a more robust state management strategy, possibly using a remote backend

1. **Enhancement Opportunities**:

   - Add support for custom notification channels
   - Implement additional dashboard widgets for more granular monitoring
   - Explore automated alerting policies based on vector database performance

1. **Testing**:

   - Validate all metrics are being properly collected
   - Test alert conditions to ensure proper triggering

## Technical Notes

### Dashboard Structure

The monitoring dashboard is organized into sections:

- Service health and uptime metrics
- Request rate and volume tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Performance metrics (latency)
- Vector database specific metrics

### Import Commands Reference

For future reference, the commands to import existing resources into Terraform state are:

```bash
terraform import google_logging_metric.requests "nyc-landmarks-vector-db.requests"
terraform import google_logging_metric.errors "nyc-landmarks-vector-db.errors"
terraform import google_logging_metric.latency "nyc-landmarks-vector-db.latency"
terraform import google_logging_metric.validation_warnings "nyc-landmarks-vector-db.validation_warnings"
```
