# Active Context

## Current Focus

Successfully completed the enhancement and testing of `scripts/fetch_landmark_reports.py` to use the unified DbClient interface and implement comprehensive pagination and filtering capabilities. All 20 tests now pass.

Additionally, completed cleanup of obsolete integration tests by removing `tests/integration/test_landmark_fetcher_integration.py` which was testing the old `LandmarkReportFetcher` class that no longer exists after the script refactoring.

## Recent Changes

### fetch_landmark_reports.py Enhancement & Testing - Complete (2025-05-26)

Successfully refactored and enhanced the landmark reports fetching script with comprehensive functionality and created a complete test suite:

#### Key Improvements

1. **Complete DbClient Integration**

   - Replaced custom `CoreDataStoreClient` with unified `DbClient` interface
   - Eliminated ~100 lines of duplicated API client code
   - Uses proper Pydantic models (`LpcReportResponse`, `LpcReportModel`)
   - Consistent error handling and logging with project standards

1. **Enhanced Pagination and Data Processing**

   - Implemented `get_total_record_count()` to determine dataset size
   - Intelligent pagination that fetches all records or respects limits
   - Progress tracking with verbose logging options
   - Robust error handling with retry logic and safety limits

1. **Comprehensive Filtering Support**

   - Borough filtering (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island)
   - Object type filtering (Individual Landmark, Historic District, etc.)
   - Neighborhood-based filtering
   - Text search capabilities
   - Architectural style filtering
   - Sorting by column with ascending/descending options

1. **Professional Documentation and CLI**

   - Complete module docstring with 20+ usage examples
   - Comprehensive argument parser with all filtering options
   - Help text and examples built into CLI
   - Dry-run capability for testing filters
   - Single-page fetching for targeted operations

1. **Enhanced Output and Metrics**

   - Processing metrics with timing and error tracking
   - Timestamped JSON output files
   - PDF URL extraction with metadata
   - Sample PDF downloading with progress tracking
   - Detailed processing summaries

#### Technical Implementation

- **Class Design**: `LandmarkReportProcessor` with clean separation of concerns
- **Data Models**: `ProcessingMetrics` and `ProcessingResult` for structured output
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints using dataclasses with `field(default_factory=list)`
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with detailed logging and graceful degradation
- **Performance**: Configurable page sizes and intelligent record counting

#### Best Practices Applied

- Uses project's centralized logger (`get_logger`)
- Follows established coding patterns and conventions
- Comprehensive docstrings and type annotations
- Proper handling of mutable defaults in dataclasses
- Structured CLI with argparse and help documentation

#### Comprehensive Test Suite

Created a complete test suite with **20 test cases** covering:

1. **LandmarkReportProcessor Tests** (17 tests):

   - Processor initialization with DbClient integration
   - Total count fetching with success and error scenarios
   - Report fetching with single page, multiple pages, and filters
   - PDF URL extraction from reports
   - Sample PDF downloading functionality
   - Complete processing workflow testing
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - File saving and output verification
   - Pagination behavior testing

1. **Data Model Tests** (3 tests):

   - ProcessingMetrics initialization and data handling
   - ProcessingResult initialization and structure validation

#### Mock Infrastructure

Built comprehensive mock utilities in `tests/mocks/fetch_landmark_reports_mocks.py`:

- `create_mock_db_client_for_processor()` - Standard success scenarios
- `create_mock_db_client_with_errors()` - Error handling scenarios
- `create_mock_db_client_empty()` - Empty result scenarios
- `get_mock_lpc_reports()` - Realistic test data with 5 landmarks
- `get_mock_lpc_report_response()` - Paginated response simulation
- `get_mock_pdf_info()` - PDF metadata for download testing

**Test Results**: All 20 tests pass successfully, validating all functionality including error handling, pagination, filtering, and data processing.

### Previous Work - PineconeDB Enhancement - Phase 1 Complete (2025-05-25)

Successfully enhanced the `PineconeDB` class with four new methods to consolidate functionality from `scripts/vector_utility.py`:

1. **`fetch_vector_by_id()`** - Consolidated vector fetching logic
1. **`list_vectors_with_filter()`** - Enhanced vector listing with prefix filtering
1. **`query_vectors_by_landmark()`** - Landmark-specific vector queries
1. **`validate_vector_metadata()`** - Comprehensive vector validation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Script Modernization**: Successfully demonstrated the pattern for refactoring legacy scripts to use unified project interfaces while maintaining all functionality and adding significant enhancements.

1. **Documentation Standards**: Established comprehensive documentation format with usage examples that should be applied to other scripts in the project.

1. **Filtering Capabilities**: The enhanced script now supports all filtering options available in the DbClient, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and processing.

1. **Performance Optimization**: Intelligent pagination and record counting ensure efficient processing of large datasets while providing progress feedback.

1. **Testing Standards**: Created comprehensive test patterns that should be applied to other script testing, including proper mocking, error scenario coverage, and data validation.

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Vector Utility Script Refactoring

With the fetch_landmark_reports.py enhancement and testing complete, the next priority is to continue the PineconeDB consolidation work:

1. **Replace duplicated functions** in `scripts/vector_utility.py`:

   - Replace `_setup_pinecone_client()` with direct `PineconeDB` instantiation
   - Replace `fetch_vector()` with `PineconeDB.fetch_vector_by_id()`
   - Replace `query_landmark_vectors()` with `PineconeDB.query_vectors_by_landmark()`
   - Replace `list_vectors()` logic with `PineconeDB.list_vectors_with_filter()`
   - Replace validation functions with `PineconeDB.validate_vector_metadata()`

1. **Apply Documentation Standards**: Update vector_utility.py with comprehensive documentation following the pattern established in fetch_landmark_reports.py

### Expected Benefits from Completed Work

- **Code Consolidation**: Eliminated duplicate API client code, reducing maintenance burden
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Added comprehensive filtering, sorting, and search capabilities
- **Better User Experience**: Professional CLI with help text and examples
- **Improved Maintainability**: Uses project standards and unified interfaces
- **Performance Optimization**: Intelligent pagination and progress tracking
- **Quality Assurance**: Complete test coverage ensuring reliability and regression protection
