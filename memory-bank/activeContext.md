## Current Focus

### Terraform Cloud Implementation (PR #196)

We are currently implementing Terraform Cloud integration for the NYC Landmarks Vector DB project. This integration aims to improve state management, team collaboration, and operational consistency for infrastructure deployments.

The key components of this implementation include:

1. Setting up proper Terraform Cloud configuration
1. Configuring workspace settings correctly
1. Managing environment variables and authentication
1. Ensuring proper state handling
1. Documenting the setup process

Recent progress:

- Successfully configured Terraform Cloud in the project
- Created workspace in Terraform Cloud with the correct settings
- Updated the `versions.tf` file to include Terraform Cloud configuration
- Created `.terraformignore` file to prevent Python environment issues
- Fixed workspace path configuration using the Terraform Cloud API
- Marked sensitive outputs appropriately in Terraform configurations
- Successfully ran Terraform plan through Terraform Cloud

Current challenges:

- Ensuring proper variable configuration in Terraform Cloud
- Streamlining the authentication process for team members
- Managing the transition from local state to remote state

## Recent Changes

### Terraform Cloud Configuration

- Added Terraform Cloud block in `versions.tf`:

  ```hcl
  cloud {
    organization = "nyc-landmarks"
    workspaces {
      name = "nyc-landmarks-vector-db"
    }
  }
  ```

- Created `.terraformignore` file to exclude Python virtual environments and other unnecessary files from being uploaded to Terraform Cloud

- Updated the workspace configuration in Terraform Cloud using the API:

  ```bash
  curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $TF_TOKEN_NYC_LANDMARKS" \
       --header "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
       --request PATCH \
       --data '{"data":{"attributes":{"working-directory":"infrastructure/terraform"},"type":"workspaces"}}' \
       https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/organizations/nyc-landmarks/workspaces/nyc-landmarks-vector-db
  ```

- Fixed output sensitivity issues in Terraform configuration:

  - Marked project_id, dashboard_name, dashboard_url, log_views_urls, and alert_policies_urls as sensitive outputs

### API and Vector DB Monitoring

Continuing to enhance the monitoring and observability of our API and Vector Database:

- Updated logging metrics configuration
- Enhanced dashboard visualization
- Improved alert policies for better incident detection
- Set up structured logging for improved troubleshooting

## Next Steps

### Terraform Cloud Implementation

1. **Variable Setup in Terraform Cloud**:

   - Configure GCP credentials in Terraform Cloud workspace as environment variables
   - Migrate terraform.tfvars variables to Terraform Cloud workspace variables

1. **VCS Integration**:

   - Set up GitHub VCS integration with Terraform Cloud
   - Configure branch specifications for automatic runs

1. **Deployment Script Updates**:

   - Update existing deployment scripts to work with Terraform Cloud
   - Add documentation for using these scripts

1. **Testing and Validation**:

   - Perform full run cycle (plan and apply) through Terraform Cloud
   - Verify state is properly stored in Terraform Cloud
   - Test concurrent operations and state locking

1. **Documentation Updates**:

   - Update README.md with Terraform Cloud setup instructions
   - Create detailed guide for new team members

### Vector DB Enhancements

1. Complete the Query API Enhancement:

   - Finalize vector search improvements
   - Implement advanced filtering capabilities
   - Document new query parameters

1. Performance Testing:

   - Benchmark current vector search performance
   - Identify optimization opportunities
   - Implement improvements

## Decisions and Considerations

### Terraform Cloud Workspace Configuration

We decided to modify the Terraform Cloud workspace configuration to point to the correct directory (`infrastructure/terraform`) rather than restructuring our local repository. This approach minimizes changes to the existing codebase while enabling Terraform Cloud integration.

### Authentication Strategy

For GCP authentication with Terraform Cloud, we've chosen to use environment variables in the Terraform Cloud workspace rather than uploading service account key files. This approach improves security by keeping sensitive credentials out of version control.

### State Migration

We're taking a careful approach to migrating state from local to Terraform Cloud, ensuring that all team members are aware of the transition and that no state loss occurs during the process.
