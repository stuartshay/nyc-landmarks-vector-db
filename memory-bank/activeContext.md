## Current Status: DevContainer Workflow Optimization Complete

### Recently Completed Work (January 14, 2025)

#### DevContainer Test Workflow Fix

- **GitHub Actions Workflow Optimization**: Fixed failing DevContainer test workflow that was causing CI/CD issues
- **GHCR Integration**: Implemented GitHub Container Registry image pulling instead of local builds for faster, more reliable testing
- **Dependabot Branch Filtering**: Added filtering to prevent unnecessary container builds on dependabot branches
- **Container Persistence Fix**: Resolved virtual environment persistence issues in test workflow
- **Workflow Communication**: Enhanced build-to-test workflow communication with proper image tag passing

#### API Query Search Logging Flow Analysis & Documentation (January 9, 2025)

- **Complete Logging Flow Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation of the entire logging flow for POST `/api/query/search` requests
- **Mermaid Sequence Diagrams**: Developed detailed visual representations of the request flow with correlation ID propagation
- **Correlation ID Verification**: Confirmed that correlation IDs are properly used throughout the entire request lifecycle
- **Test Script Creation**: Built practical test script to demonstrate correlation ID logging in action

#### Key Deliverables

1. **Documentation Files Created**

   - `docs/api_query_search_logging_flow.md`: Complete step-by-step logging flow analysis
   - `docs/api_query_search_sequence_diagram.md`: Mermaid diagrams showing request flow and correlation ID lifecycle
   - `scripts/test_correlation_logging_flow.py`: Test script for demonstrating correlation ID usage

1. **Correlation ID Flow Verification**

   - ✅ Middleware layer: Request body logging, performance monitoring
   - ✅ API layer: Input validation, embedding generation
   - ✅ Business logic: Vector database queries with correlation tracking
   - ✅ All components properly propagate correlation IDs for log aggregation

1. **Logging Components Analyzed**

   - Request Body Logging Middleware (`nyc_landmarks/api/request_body_logging_middleware.py`)
   - Validation Logger (`nyc_landmarks/utils/validation.py`)
   - Query API Endpoint (`nyc_landmarks/api/query.py`)
   - Vector Database (`nyc_landmarks/vectordb/pinecone_db.py`)
   - Embedding Generator (`nyc_landmarks/embeddings/generator.py`)
   - Performance Middleware (`nyc_landmarks/api/middleware.py`)

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Correlation ID Propagation Flow:**

1. **Header Extraction**: `get_correlation_id(request)` extracts from X-Request-ID, X-Correlation-ID, etc.
1. **UUID Generation**: Auto-generates UUID4 if no correlation header found
1. **Middleware Logging**: All middleware components log with correlation ID
1. **API Processing**: Validation, embedding generation, and vector queries include correlation ID
1. **Performance Tracking**: Request timing and metrics logged with correlation ID

**Log Aggregation Strategy:**

- All log entries contain the same correlation ID for a single request
- Enables complete request tracing across all system components
- Supports both text-based (`grep`) and JSON-based (`jq`) log analysis
- Provides structured logging for monitoring and debugging

**Sequence Diagram Components:**

- Request flow through middleware stack
- API endpoint processing with validation
- Embedding generation and vector database queries
- Performance monitoring and response generation
- Correlation ID lifecycle management

#### Verification Results

- ✅ Correlation ID properly extracted from request headers
- ✅ UUID4 generation when no correlation header present
- ✅ All logging components include correlation ID in log entries
- ✅ Vector database operations propagate correlation ID
- ✅ Performance metrics include correlation ID for aggregation
- ✅ Complete request tracing capability confirmed

## Previous Status: Environment Setup Complete with Security Tools

### Recently Completed Work

#### Python 3.13 Environment Setup Enhancement (January 7, 2025)

- **Enhanced setup_env.sh script** with gitleaks and Terraform installation
- **Fixed pre-commit hook failures** that were preventing proper code quality checks
- **Added comprehensive security tools support** for development workflow

#### Key Accomplishments

1. **Security Tools Integration**

   - Added gitleaks v8.21.2 installation for secret detection
   - Added Terraform v1.12.2 installation for infrastructure management
   - Both tools now properly integrated into pre-commit workflow

1. **Enhanced Setup Script Features**

   - New `--skip-security-tools` option for flexibility
   - Cross-platform installation support (Linux, macOS)
   - Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Comprehensive validation of all installed tools

1. **Pre-commit Hook Resolution**

   - All pre-commit hooks now pass successfully
   - Terraform format and validate hooks working correctly
   - Gitleaks secret detection integrated into commit workflow
   - Removed problematic autopep8 hook (replaced with Black for formatting)

1. **Installation Methods**

   - **Gitleaks**: Direct download from GitHub releases for Linux, Homebrew for macOS
   - **Terraform**: HashiCorp official repositories for Linux, Homebrew for macOS
   - **Fallback**: Direct binary downloads for unsupported package managers

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Script Enhancements:**

- Added version constants for gitleaks (8.21.2) and Terraform (1.10.3)
- Implemented `install_gitleaks()` and `install_terraform()` functions
- Added `setup_security_tools()` orchestration function
- Enhanced validation to check security tools installation
- Updated command-line argument parsing for new options

**Cross-Platform Support:**

- Ubuntu/Debian: Uses official HashiCorp apt repository for Terraform
- RHEL/CentOS/Fedora: Uses official HashiCorp yum/dnf repository
- macOS: Uses Homebrew for both tools
- Generic Linux: Direct binary downloads as fallback

**Error Handling:**

- Graceful degradation if security tools fail to install
- Clear logging of installation progress and errors
- Non-blocking failures (setup continues with warnings)

#### Validation Results

- ✅ All pre-commit hooks passing (26/26)
- ✅ Python 3.13.5 environment fully functional
- ✅ Gitleaks v8.21.2 installed and working
- ✅ Terraform v1.12.2 installed and working
- ✅ All project dependencies installed correctly
- ✅ Development tools (Black, mypy, pytest) working
- ✅ Jupyter environment configured

### Current Environment State

**Python Environment:**

- Python 3.13.5 in virtual environment (.venv)
- All requirements.txt dependencies installed
- Project installed in editable mode
- Pre-commit hooks configured and working

**Security Tools:**

- Gitleaks: Secret detection and API key scanning
- Terraform: Infrastructure as code validation
- Both integrated into pre-commit workflow

**Development Tools:**

- Black: Code formatting
- isort: Import sorting
- mypy: Type checking
- pytest: Testing framework
- Jupyter: Notebook environment

### Next Steps

The environment is now fully configured and ready for development work. The enhanced setup script resolves the pre-commit hook failures and provides a robust foundation for:

1. **Secure Development**: Automatic secret detection prevents accidental commits of API keys
1. **Infrastructure Management**: Terraform validation ensures infrastructure code quality
1. **Code Quality**: Comprehensive linting and formatting tools maintain code standards
1. **Cross-Platform Support**: Setup script works across different operating systems

### Usage

To use the enhanced setup script:

```bash
# Standard installation with security tools
./setup_env.sh

# Skip security tools if not needed
./setup_env.sh --skip-security-tools

# Verbose output for debugging
./setup_env.sh --verbose

# Skip Python installation (use existing)
./setup_env.sh --skip-python
```

All pre-commit hooks now pass successfully, resolving the original Terraform and gitleaks issues.
