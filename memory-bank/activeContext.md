   - Added `--landmark-ids` support for processing specific landmarks
   - Added `--verbose` flag for detailed logging
   - Replaced `--recreate-index`/`--drop-index` with `--delete-existing` for consistency
   - Retained `--page-size`, `--limit`, `--parallel`, `--workers` (already aligned)
   - Retained `--download` (landmarks-specific functionality)

1. **Added Required Helper Functions:**

   - `get_all_landmark_ids()` - Fetch landmark IDs with pagination support
   - `parse_arguments()` - Parse command line arguments with mutually exclusive groups

     python scripts/ci/process_landmarks.py --landmark-ids LP-00079 --verbose
     python scripts/ci/process_landmarks.py --all --verbose
     ```
   - Added proper type hints and comprehensive documentation

1. **Maintained Backwards Compatibility:**

   - All existing pipeline functionality preserved

### DB Client Edge Case Tests Fix - Complete (2025-05-27)

Successfully resolved all failing tests in the DB client edge cases test suite by implementing missing helper methods:

#### Problem Identified

- 5 tests were failing with `AttributeError` for missing methods `_fetch_buildings_from_client` and `_fetch_buildings_from_landmark_detail`
- Tests expected these private helper methods to exist in the `DbClient` class
- These methods were referenced in other test files but were missing from the actual implementation

#### Solution Implemented

Added two missing helper methods to `nyc_landmarks/db/db_client.py`:

1. **`_fetch_buildings_from_client()`**:

   - Attempts to fetch buildings using the client's `get_landmark_buildings` method
   - Returns empty list if method doesn't exist or fails
   - Includes proper error handling and logging
   - Uses type casting to ensure compatibility with union types

1. **`_fetch_buildings_from_landmark_detail()`**:

   - Fetches buildings from landmark detail response as fallback
   - Validates response type and attributes before processing
   - Filters out invalid items and respects limit parameter
   - Robust error handling for various edge cases

1. **Enhanced `get_landmark_buildings()`**:

   - Now uses both helper methods in sequence (primary + fallback)
   - Standardizes landmark ID format
   - Converts all items to `LpcReportModel` objects
   - Maintains existing public interface while adding internal robustness

#### Technical Details

- **Type Safety**: Added proper type casting using `cast()` to resolve mypy errors
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with detailed logging
- **Fallback Logic**: Primary method tries client API, fallback uses landmark detail response
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Handles missing methods, invalid responses, and malformed data
- **Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

#### Test Results

- **Before**: 5 failed, 12 passed (17 total)
- **After**: 17 passed (100% success rate)

All edge case scenarios now properly tested including:

- Missing API methods (hasattr checks)
- Invalid response types
- Missing attributes in responses
- Exception handling
- Empty result scenarios
