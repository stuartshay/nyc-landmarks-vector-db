## Current Status: Environment Setup Complete with Security Tools

### Recently Completed Work

#### Python 3.13 Environment Setup Enhancement (January 7, 2025)

- **Enhanced setup_env.sh script** with gitleaks and Terraform installation
- **Fixed pre-commit hook failures** that were preventing proper code quality checks
- **Added comprehensive security tools support** for development workflow

#### Key Accomplishments

1. **Security Tools Integration**

   - Added gitleaks v8.21.2 installation for secret detection
   - Added Terraform v1.12.2 installation for infrastructure management
   - Both tools now properly integrated into pre-commit workflow

1. **Enhanced Setup Script Features**

   - New `--skip-security-tools` option for flexibility
   - Cross-platform installation support (Linux, macOS)
   - Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Comprehensive validation of all installed tools

1. **Pre-commit Hook Resolution**

   - All pre-commit hooks now pass successfully
   - Terraform format and validate hooks working correctly
   - Gitleaks secret detection integrated into commit workflow
   - Removed problematic autopep8 hook (replaced with Black for formatting)

1. **Installation Methods**

   - **Gitleaks**: Direct download from GitHub releases for Linux, Homebrew for macOS
   - **Terraform**: HashiCorp official repositories for Linux, Homebrew for macOS
   - **Fallback**: Direct binary downloads for unsupported package managers

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Script Enhancements:**

- Added version constants for gitleaks (8.21.2) and Terraform (1.10.3)
- Implemented `install_gitleaks()` and `install_terraform()` functions
- Added `setup_security_tools()` orchestration function
- Enhanced validation to check security tools installation
- Updated command-line argument parsing for new options

**Cross-Platform Support:**

- Ubuntu/Debian: Uses official HashiCorp apt repository for Terraform
- RHEL/CentOS/Fedora: Uses official HashiCorp yum/dnf repository
- macOS: Uses Homebrew for both tools
- Generic Linux: Direct binary downloads as fallback

**Error Handling:**

- Graceful degradation if security tools fail to install
- Clear logging of installation progress and errors
- Non-blocking failures (setup continues with warnings)

#### Validation Results

- ✅ All pre-commit hooks passing (26/26)
- ✅ Python 3.13.5 environment fully functional
- ✅ Gitleaks v8.21.2 installed and working
- ✅ Terraform v1.12.2 installed and working
- ✅ All project dependencies installed correctly
- ✅ Development tools (Black, mypy, pytest) working
- ✅ Jupyter environment configured

### Current Environment State

**Python Environment:**

- Python 3.13.5 in virtual environment (.venv)
- All requirements.txt dependencies installed
- Project installed in editable mode
- Pre-commit hooks configured and working

**Security Tools:**

- Gitleaks: Secret detection and API key scanning
- Terraform: Infrastructure as code validation
- Both integrated into pre-commit workflow

**Development Tools:**

- Black: Code formatting
- isort: Import sorting
- mypy: Type checking
- pytest: Testing framework
- Jupyter: Notebook environment

### Next Steps

The environment is now fully configured and ready for development work. The enhanced setup script resolves the pre-commit hook failures and provides a robust foundation for:

1. **Secure Development**: Automatic secret detection prevents accidental commits of API keys
1. **Infrastructure Management**: Terraform validation ensures infrastructure code quality
1. **Code Quality**: Comprehensive linting and formatting tools maintain code standards
1. **Cross-Platform Support**: Setup script works across different operating systems

### Usage

To use the enhanced setup script:

```bash
# Standard installation with security tools
./setup_env.sh

# Skip security tools if not needed
./setup_env.sh --skip-security-tools

# Verbose output for debugging
./setup_env.sh --verbose

# Skip Python installation (use existing)
./setup_env.sh --skip-python
```

All pre-commit hooks now pass successfully, resolving the original Terraform and gitleaks issues.
