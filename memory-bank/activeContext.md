# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on the Wikipedia Processing Script Refactoring & Metadata Enhancement Project. This involves refactoring the large `scripts/ci/process_wikipedia_articles.py` script (757 lines) into modular components while conducting comprehensive analysis of Wikipedia articles for metadata enhancement opportunities.

## Recent Changes

- **Completed Wikipedia Processing Refactoring**: Successfully refactored the large `scripts/ci/process_wikipedia_articles.py` script (757 lines) to use the modular `WikipediaProcessor` class. The main script now focuses on orchestration logic, command-line argument handling, and results reporting while delegating core Wikipedia processing functionality to the dedicated `WikipediaProcessor` class.
- **Enhanced Vector Query Capabilities in PineconeDB**: Significantly improved the vector database query functionality with enhanced filtering options, better namespace handling, and more robust error recovery. Consolidated multiple query methods into a single, more powerful `query_vectors` method with comprehensive options for different use cases.
- **Enhanced Vector Utility Tool**: Extensively improved the `scripts/vector_utility.py` tool with comprehensive capabilities for vector inspection, validation, and comparison. Added robust handling of different building metadata formats and better formatting for displaying vector information.
- **Implemented flattened building metadata**: Refactored the building metadata storage approach from nested arrays to flattened key-value pairs (e.g., `building_0_name`, `building_0_address`) to ensure compatibility with Pinecone's metadata constraints and enable filtering by building attributes. Created the `_flatten_buildings_metadata` method in the `EnhancedMetadataCollector` class and updated dependent code in PineconeDB and WikipediaProcessor to handle the new format while preserving all building information. Added support for `building_names` array field for simplified filtering by building name.
- **Added Wikipedia article quality assessment and filtering**: Implemented integration with the Wikimedia Lift Wing articlequality API to assess the quality of Wikipedia articles (FA, GA, B, C, Start, Stub). This data is stored in article metadata and propagated to vector chunks for improved search filtering and ranking. Quality assessment includes quality level, confidence scores, and human-readable descriptions. The system now filters out low-quality articles (Stub and Start classifications) early in the processing pipeline to improve the overall quality of the vector database.
- **Added Wikipedia revision ID tracking**: Enhanced the Wikipedia fetcher and processor to track article revision IDs, providing better versioning and citation support for all Wikipedia content. This revision ID is now consistently propagated through the entire pipeline from fetching to storage in the vector database.
- **Fixed return type in `WikipediaFetcher.fetch_wikipedia_content`**: Updated the method to consistently return a tuple of (content, rev_id) for better error handling and type consistency.
- **Enhanced metadata in Wikipedia chunks**: Included revision IDs in chunk metadata to enable precise article version tracking for citations and updates.
- **Successfully implemented `nyc_landmarks/wikipedia/processor.py`**: Created the `WikipediaProcessor` class as planned in Phase 1 of the refactoring project, extracting core Wikipedia processing functionality from the main script.
- **Created Wikipedia package structure**: Established `nyc_landmarks/wikipedia/` directory with proper module organization.
- **Developed custom Wikipedia analysis script**: Implemented `scripts/analyze_wikipedia_article.py` to analyze individual Wikipedia articles and extract potential metadata attributes.
- **Added landmarks processing module**: Created `nyc_landmarks/landmarks/landmarks_processing.py` to support the refactoring effort.
- **Enhanced results reporting**: Added `nyc_landmarks/utils/results_reporter.py` for better statistics and reporting capabilities.
- **Created API Enhancement Analysis Script**: Added `scripts/analyze_api_enhancements.py` to test underutilized CoreDataStore APIs for Phase 2 of the Wikipedia refactoring project.
- **Fixed Package Version Synchronization Workflow**: Implemented `scripts/ci/sync_versions.sh` and updated GitHub Actions workflow to automatically sync package versions between requirements.txt and setup.py for Dependabot PRs.
- **Simplified Building Metadata Integration**: Refactored `EnhancedMetadataCollector._add_building_data` method to remove redundant direct API calls and rely solely on the DbClient method, which already calls the same CoreDataStore API endpoint. This simplifies the code, removes duplication, and maintains all functionality.
- **Documented Building Metadata Integration**: Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/building_metadata_integration.md` explaining the implementation, known issues with field mapping, and potential future improvements.
- **Tested Building Metadata Integration**: Successfully tested the updated implementation with `scripts/test_building_metadata.py` and identified a field mapping issue where some building data fields aren't properly preserved during model conversion.
- **Enhanced Building Data Display in Vector Utility**: Improved the `process_building_data` function in `scripts/vector_utility.py` to better handle building data in vector metadata, including handling for empty arrays, non-dictionary data types, and more robust detection of missing data. This allows for consistent display of building information across various data formats.

## Next Steps

1. Performance optimization

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Refactoring Architecture

- Maintaining backward compatibility while improving modularity
- Ensuring no breaking changes to existing interfaces
- Preserving all existing functionality during the transition

### Metadata Enhancement Strategy

- Focus on non-intrusive enhancements that don't break current functionality
- Implement optional enhanced metadata collection that can be enabled/disabled
- Prioritize API integrations based on data quality and processing performance impact
- Use direct API requests when CoreDataStore client methods are insufficient, with proper error handling

### Building Metadata Integration

- Identified redundant API call pattern: both direct `requests` call and DbClient method were calling the same endpoint (`https://api.coredatastore.com/api/LpcReport/landmark/{limit}/1?LpcNumber={lp_id}`)
- Simplified implementation to use only the DbClient method, removing unnecessary complexity
- ✅ Resolved field mapping issue by implementing comprehensive field preservation in the `_add_building_data` method
- ✅ Created the `_flatten_buildings_metadata` method which properly transforms nested building data into Pinecone-compatible flattened format while preserving all critical fields
- ✅ Implemented careful handling of both dictionary and object building data to ensure consistent field extraction
- ✅ Verified the solution with the processing script and vector utility tool
- ✅ Updated vector_utility.py to properly display building metadata in inspection output with improved handling of:
  - Empty building arrays (display "No building data found" message)
  - Non-dictionary building data (handle string or other simple types)
  - Multiple buildings in a single landmark (proper formatting for each building)
  - Missing or null field values (skip displaying them instead of showing "None")

### Testing and Validation

- Need to thoroughly test refactored components against original script behavior
- Validate that Wikipedia processing performance is maintained or improved
- Ensure proper error handling and logging throughout the refactored modules

## Current Challenges

- Balancing code modularity with maintaining existing functionality
- Managing the complexity of multiple API integrations while keeping performance optimal
- Ensuring comprehensive testing coverage for the refactored components
- Coordinating the phased approach to avoid disrupting existing workflows
- Testing vector operations with different metadata formats to ensure backward compatibility
- Validating that the streamlined main script maintains feature parity with the original implementation
- Ensuring the improved vector query capabilities work correctly with all filtering combinations
