  - Improved BBL handling with consistent normalization of empty values to None

- **EnhancedMetadataCollector Testing**: Successfully completed comprehensive unit tests following established patterns:

  - Created a new `test_enhanced_metadata_collector.py` file targeting the EnhancedMetadataCollector class
  - Implemented mocks for DB client and CoreDataStoreAPI with proper patching
  - Created test cases for both API and non-API modes of operation

  - Added detailed documentation in `tests/unit/README.md`
  - Added detailed test improvement documentation in `memory-bank/test-improvements.md`
  - Achieved 96% code coverage, well above the 80% target

- **API Integration Fix**: Fixed Wikipedia article processing by updating the CoreDataStoreAPI's `get_wikipedia_articles` method to:

  - Use the correct `/api/WebContent/batch` endpoint with POST request
  - Properly handle case-insensitive landmark IDs in response keys (e.g., 'lP-00009' vs 'LP-00009')
  - Add robust type checking and validation for API responses
  - Implement detailed logging of raw API responses for debugging
  - Correctly filter records by recordType with proper type checking

- **Feature Enhancement**: Added `--page-size` parameter to `process_wikipedia_articles.py` to control the number of landmarks fetched per API request. This feature:

  - Makes the page size configurable (default: 100)
  - Allows optimizing API requests based on server load and network conditions
  - Provides better control over processing batches
  - Can be used to tune performance based on available resources
  - Supports parameter combinations like `--all --page-size 50` to process all landmarks with smaller batches
  - Can be combined with `--limit` as in `--all --page-size 50 --limit 5` to process a limited number of landmarks

- **Argument Validation**: Implemented mutual exclusivity between `--all` and `--page` parameters:

  - Used argparse's mutually exclusive group feature
  - Added clear error message when both parameters are used together
  - Enhanced help text to indicate incompatible arguments
  - Ensured proper validation to enforce supported usage patterns

- **Feature Enhancement**: Added `--all` parameter to `process_wikipedia_articles.py` to process the entire database. This feature:

  - Uses the `get_total_record_count()` method from `DbClient` to determine the total number of landmarks
  - Allows processing all available landmarks in a single run
  - Can be combined with `--limit` to process only a subset of the total records

- **Feature Enhancement**: Added `--page` parameter to `process_wikipedia_articles.py` to allow starting the landmark fetch from a specific page number. This enables:

  - Resuming failed processing runs from a specific page
  - Distributing processing workload across multiple runs
  - Processing specific subsets of landmarks by page number
  - Better control over which landmarks are processed

- **Code Fix**: Fixed Pyright error in `check_landmark_processing.py` by correctly
  formatting the file-level setting directive on its own line. The error "Pyright
  comments used to control file-level settings must appear on their own line" was
  resolved by ensuring the `# pyright: reportMissingImports=false` directive appears on
  its own line without other comments.

- **Bug Fix**: Fixed the "'LpcReportDetailResponse' object has no attribute 'get'" error
  in the landmark processing pipeline by implementing a safe attribute accessor that
  works with both dictionary-style objects and Pydantic models

- Created a reusable `safe_get_attribute()` function that abstracts away the differences
  between dictionary-style access and attribute access

- Fixed type annotation issues to properly handle both dictionary responses and Pydantic
  model objects

- Added enhanced error logging for problematic landmark IDs (LP-00048, LP-00112,
  LP-00012)

- Refactored complex functions into smaller, focused helper functions to reduce
  cognitive complexity:

  - Added `extract_landmark_id()` to cleanly handle ID extraction from different object
    types
  - Added `fetch_landmarks_page()` to centralize API request logic and error handling
  - Added `get_landmark_pdf_url()` to extract PDF URLs consistently
  - Added `create_chunk_metadata()` to standardize metadata generation
  - Added `generate_and_validate_embedding()` to handle embedding generation and
    validation

- Successfully processed previously failing landmarks with the updated code

## Active Decisions

- **Test Mock Organization**:

  - Created a dedicated `tests/mocks` directory to house all shared mock data
  - Implemented a function-based approach for mock data access with proper typing
  - Used consistent naming convention for mock functions (get_mock\_\*)
  - Maintained backward compatibility by keeping the existing API of the mock data
  - Laid groundwork for additional mock data extraction in future refactorings

- **EnhancedMetadataCollector Simplification**:

  - Decided to remove helper methods from models and use direct property access for simpler code
  - Standardized on a 1:1 mapping between API fields and metadata fields
  - Maintained the same functionality while reducing code complexity
  - For BBL and photoStatus specifically, using direct field access rather than transformations

- **Test Organization Strategy**:

  - Organized tests into three files (`test_db_client.py`, `test_db_client_additional.py`, `test_db_client_coverage.py`) for clarity
  - Structured test classes by functional areas (core methods, conversion methods, Wikipedia integration, etc.)
  - Used consistent naming conventions for test methods to clearly indicate what's being tested
  - Documented remaining uncovered lines (10 lines at 96% coverage) with explanations for why they're difficult to test

- **Script Enhancements**:

  - Added a new `--all` option to process all available landmarks in the database
  - Integrated with the `DbClient.get_total_record_count()` method to determine the total number of landmarks
  - Made `process_all` an optional parameter with a default value of `False` to maintain backward compatibility
  - Ensured that `--all` respects the `--limit` option if provided (using the smaller of the two values)
  - Added pagination support to `process_wikipedia_articles.py` to give more control over landmark processing
  - Made `start_page` an optional parameter with a default value of 1 to maintain backward compatibility
  - Updated functions to properly handle the new parameter throughout the processing pipeline

- **Code Quality Improvements**:

  - Used a unified attribute access approach with the `safe_get_attribute()` function
    instead of maintaining separate code paths for different object types
  - Improved type annotations to ensure proper static type checking
  - Added better logging for debugging problematic landmark processing
  - Enhanced robustness by handling both dictionary and object attribute access patterns
    consistently
  - Adopted a modular approach to break down complex functions into smaller, more focused
    units with clear responsibilities
