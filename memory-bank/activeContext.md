# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Fixed issues with processing certain landmarks in `process_all_landmarks.py` script
- Implemented a more robust attribute access mechanism using a `safe_get_attribute()` helper function
- Resolved type checking errors and improved code reliability
- Refactored complex functions in the landmark processing pipeline to reduce complexity

## Recent Changes

- **Code Fix**: Fixed Pyright error in `check_landmark_processing.py` by correctly formatting the file-level setting directive on its own line. The error "Pyright comments used to control file-level settings must appear on their own line" was resolved by ensuring the `# pyright: reportMissingImports=false` directive appears on its own line without other comments.
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed the "'LpcReportDetailResponse' object has no attribute 'get'" error in the landmark processing pipeline by implementing a safe attribute accessor that works with both dictionary-style objects and Pydantic models
- Created a reusable `safe_get_attribute()` function that abstracts away the differences between dictionary-style access and attribute access
- Fixed type annotation issues to properly handle both dictionary responses and Pydantic model objects
- Added enhanced error logging for problematic landmark IDs (LP-00048, LP-00112, LP-00012)
- Refactored complex functions into smaller, focused helper functions to reduce cognitive complexity:
  - Added `extract_landmark_id()` to cleanly handle ID extraction from different object types
  - Added `fetch_landmarks_page()` to centralize API request logic and error handling
  - Added `get_landmark_pdf_url()` to extract PDF URLs consistently
  - Added `create_chunk_metadata()` to standardize metadata generation
  - Added `generate_and_validate_embedding()` to handle embedding generation and validation
- Successfully processed previously failing landmarks with the updated code

## Active Decisions

- Used a unified attribute access approach with the `safe_get_attribute()` function instead of maintaining separate code paths for different object types
- Improved type annotations to ensure proper static type checking
- Added better logging for debugging problematic landmark processing
- Enhanced robustness by handling both dictionary and object attribute access patterns consistently
- Adopted a modular approach to break down complex functions into smaller, more focused units with clear responsibilities

## Next Steps

- Continue monitoring landmark processing to ensure no new errors occur
- Consider applying similar robust attribute access patterns in other parts of the codebase
- Update test cases to verify both dictionary and object attribute access works as expected
- Consider adding additional error handling and recovery mechanisms to make processing even more robust
- Apply similar refactoring techniques to other complex functions in the codebase to improve maintainability
