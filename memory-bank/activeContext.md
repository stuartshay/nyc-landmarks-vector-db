# Active Context

This document contains the most recent updates and work in progress for the NYC Landmarks Vector Database.

## Current Focus

We're addressing issues with the Pinecone vector database integration and solving critical bugs in the landmark processing pipeline.

### Recent Updates (May 11, 2025)

- Fixed an issue with the Pinecone index recreation process by properly adding the required `ServerlessSpec` parameter in `PineconeDB.recreate_index()` method
- Resolved error processing specific landmark IDs (LP-00048, LP-00112, LP-00012) by improving attribute access in `process_all_landmarks.py`
- Added additional debugging to the `verify_vectors.py` script to better diagnose issues with vector embeddings
- Successfully processed and stored landmark data for previously problematic landmarks in the Pinecone index
- Fixed vector embedding storage in Pinecone by adding `include_values=True` parameter to `index.query()` calls in `list_vectors_by_source()` method

### API Issues

Recent errors were due to three main issues:

1. **Pinecone API Issue**: The Pinecone client API was missing a required `spec` parameter when recreating indexes, causing failures with the error: `Pinecone.create_index() missing 1 required positional argument: 'spec'`

2. **Landmark Response Type Handling**: The processing pipeline was failing to properly handle different response types from the LPC Report API, specifically there was an issue with the `'LpcReportDetailResponse' object has no attribute 'get'` error because the code was trying to use dictionary access methods on a Pydantic model

3. **Missing Vector Embeddings**: The Pinecone query in `list_vectors_by_source()` was not explicitly requesting vector values (embeddings) by omitting the `include_values=True` parameter, causing stored vectors to appear as if they had no embeddings

### Current Vector Storage State

- The Pinecone index has been properly configured with the correct parameters
- Successfully processed all previously problematic landmarks with proper embeddings
- Vector verification now shows 100% valid embeddings for all vectors in the index
- The vector retrieval system is now correctly including embedding values in query responses

## In Progress Work

- Enhanced error checking in the landmark processing pipeline to better handle different response types
- More comprehensive verification of vector data quality
- Further improvements to vector retrieval and search capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Continue processing remaining landmarks to populate the vector database
2. Ensure all landmarks are properly embedding their text content
3. Optimize the verification and quality checking of vector embeddings
4. Update the query API to better utilize the improved vector storage
5. Enhance error handling for both Pinecone API calls and landmark data processing
6. Run full verification on the entire index to ensure all vectors have valid embeddings
