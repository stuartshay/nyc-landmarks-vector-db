This document captures the current focus of development, recent changes, and immediate next steps.

## Current Focus

### Test Suite Improvements - PR #219 Suggestions (COMPLETED) ✅

Recently completed implementation of all test improvement suggestions from PR #219, focusing on eliminating code duplication and improving test maintainability.

**Completed Work:**

1. **PineconeDB Test Improvements** ✅

   - Created `BaseTestPineconeDB` class to centralize common setup/mocking logic
   - Eliminated duplicated setUp methods across 6 test classes
   - Improved test organization with proper inheritance hierarchy
   - All 46 PineconeDB tests passing

1. **Wikipedia Processor Test Deduplication** ✅

   - Created `BaseWikipediaProcessorTest` class to eliminate code duplication
   - Refactored 6 test classes to inherit from base class
   - Removed 150+ lines of duplicated setUp/tearDown code
   - All 16 Wikipedia processor tests passing
   - Fixed initialization test logic to properly verify mock assignments

**Results:**

- Reduced test code duplication by ~80% in affected files
- Improved maintainability through single source of truth for setup logic
- Enhanced test reliability through consistent mock configuration
- Preserved all existing test functionality and coverage

### Previous: Terraform Cloud Implementation (PR #196)

Terraform Cloud integration was successfully implemented for the NYC Landmarks Vector DB project, improving state management, team collaboration, and operational consistency for infrastructure deployments.

## Recent Changes

### Type Checking Fix for Logger Tests

- Fixed mypy type checking errors in `tests/unit/utils/test_logger.py`:
  - **Issue**: Lines 701 and 717 had errors where mypy couldn't recognize that `handler.close` and `handler.flush` were mock objects with assertion methods
  - **Root Cause**: Mock objects created with `MagicMock()` were being treated as regular callables, so `.assert_called_once()` was not recognized as a valid attribute
  - **Solution**: Added `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` comments to suppress the specific mypy errors for mock assertion calls
  - **Result**: Mypy now passes successfully with no type checking errors

### Terraform Cloud Configuration

- Added Terraform Cloud block in `versions.tf`:

  ```hcl
  cloud {
    organization = "nyc-landmarks"
    workspaces {
      name = "nyc-landmarks-vector-db"
    }
  }
  ```

- Created `.terraformignore` file to exclude Python virtual environments and other unnecessary files from being uploaded to Terraform Cloud

- Updated the workspace configuration in Terraform Cloud using the API:

  ```bash
  curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $TF_TOKEN_NYC_LANDMARKS" \
       --header "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
       --request PATCH \
       --data '{"data":{"attributes":{"working-directory":"infrastructure/terraform"},"type":"workspaces"}}' \
       https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/organizations/nyc-landmarks/workspaces/nyc-landmarks-vector-db
  ```

- Fixed output sensitivity issues in Terraform configuration:

  - Marked project_id, dashboard_name, dashboard_url, log_views_urls, and alert_policies_urls as sensitive outputs

### API and Vector DB Monitoring

Continuing to enhance the monitoring and observability of our API and Vector Database:

- Updated logging metrics configuration
- Enhanced dashboard visualization
- Improved alert policies for better incident detection
- Set up structured logging for improved troubleshooting

## Next Steps

### Terraform Cloud Implementation

1. **Variable Setup in Terraform Cloud**:

   - Configure GCP credentials in Terraform Cloud workspace as environment variables
   - Migrate terraform.tfvars variables to Terraform Cloud workspace variables

1. **VCS Integration**:

   - Set up GitHub VCS integration with Terraform Cloud
   - Configure branch specifications for automatic runs

1. **Deployment Script Updates**:

   - Update existing deployment scripts to work with Terraform Cloud
   - Add documentation for using these scripts

1. **Testing and Validation**:

   - Perform full run cycle (plan and apply) through Terraform Cloud
   - Verify state is properly stored in Terraform Cloud
   - Test concurrent operations and state locking

1. **Documentation Updates**:

   - Update README.md with Terraform Cloud setup instructions
   - Create detailed guide for new team members

### Vector DB Enhancements

1. Complete the Query API Enhancement:

   - Finalize vector search improvements
   - Implement advanced filtering capabilities
   - Document new query parameters

1. Performance Testing:

   - Benchmark current vector search performance
   - Identify optimization opportunities
   - Implement improvements

## Decisions and Considerations

### Terraform Cloud Workspace Configuration

We decided to modify the Terraform Cloud workspace configuration to point to the correct directory (`infrastructure/terraform`) rather than restructuring our local repository. This approach minimizes changes to the existing codebase while enabling Terraform Cloud integration.

### Authentication Strategy

For GCP authentication with Terraform Cloud, we've chosen to use environment variables in the Terraform Cloud workspace rather than uploading service account key files. This approach improves security by keeping sensitive credentials out of version control.

### State Migration

We're taking a careful approach to migrating state from local to Terraform Cloud, ensuring that all team members are aware of the transition and that no state loss occurs during the process.
