# Active Context

## Current Focus

While continuing to work on the Wikipedia API Improvement Project, we have completed significant enhancements to the Google Cloud Logging implementation, greatly improving observability, security monitoring, and performance analysis capabilities. We are now evaluating the Terraform Monitoring Configuration PR (#158), which adds comprehensive Terraform support for infrastructure management and monitoring. Additionally, we have successfully set up a local SonarQube instance for code quality analysis to improve the project's overall code quality and identify potential issues.

### Terraform Monitoring Configuration (PR #158)

PR #158 introduces Terraform support for the project, including updates to the development environment, pre-commit hooks, and detailed documentation for setup and usage. The implementation includes:

- **DevContainer Integration**: Added Terraform support to the devcontainer by including the `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/terraform:1` feature and enabling Terraform-specific VS Code settings
- **Pre-commit Validation**: Integrated `terraform_fmt` and `terraform_validate` hooks into `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for automatic formatting and validation of Terraform files
- **Terraform Configuration**: Added configuration files in `infrastructure/terraform/` for log-based metrics, monitoring dashboard resources, uptime checks, and Cloud Scheduler jobs
- **Infrastructure as Code Resources**:
  - Log-based metrics for requests, errors, latency, and validation warnings
  - Comprehensive monitoring dashboard in Google Cloud Console
  - Uptime check for the /health endpoint with content validation
  - Cloud Scheduler job that runs every 5 minutes to monitor the health endpoint
- **Deployment Scripts**: Created `setup_terraform.sh`, `deploy_dashboard.sh`, and `health_check.sh` for streamlined setup and deployment
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed documentation in `docs/terraform_monitoring_setup.md` and `docs/terraform_precommit_validation.md`
- **Legacy Script Deprecation**: Marked `create_api_dashboard.sh` as deprecated, advising users to switch to the Terraform-based setup

This implementation provides a more robust, version-controlled approach to infrastructure management, particularly for monitoring resources. The use of Terraform ensures consistency across environments, better visibility into infrastructure changes through version control, and a more maintainable approach to infrastructure management.

### Google Cloud Logging Implementation

The Google Cloud Logging integration has been significantly enhanced while maintaining its provider-agnostic design. The system now features structured logging, request context tracking, performance monitoring, and standardized error classification. The implementation includes:

- **Enhanced Provider-Agnostic Architecture**: Maintained clean separation between logging interface and provider implementations, with simple toggling via `LOG_PROVIDER` environment variable
- **Structured JSON Logging**: Added a `StructuredFormatter` class that outputs logs in JSON format with standardized fields
- **Request Context Tracking**: Implemented context variable management for tracking request information throughout the application
- **Performance Monitoring**: Added specialized logging for operation durations and success rates
- **Error Classification**: Enhanced error logging with standardized categorization and detailed error information
- **FastAPI Middleware Integration**: Created middleware components for automatic request tracking and performance monitoring
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed documentation in `docs/google_cloud_logging_enhancements.md`
- **Demonstration Script**: Created `scripts/demonstrate_logging.py` to showcase the new capabilities

These enhancements make it much easier to:

- Track requests across multiple components
- Monitor API endpoint performance
- Identify and troubleshoot errors
- Filter logs by various criteria (request ID, error type, endpoint, etc.)
- Generate performance reports and alerts

### Wikipedia API Improvement Project

Having successfully completed the refactoring of `scripts/ci/process_wikipedia_articles.py` into modular components, we are focusing on improving the API calls within the Wikipedia processing components to enhance performance, reliability, and efficiency.

## Recent Changes

- **Enhanced SonarQube Setup with Token Authentication and Comprehensive Test Reporting**: Improved the SonarQube setup with robust token-based authentication for API access and added comprehensive test reporting. Created `.sonarqube/setup-token.sh` to automatically generate and manage authentication tokens during startup. Enhanced `run-analysis.sh` to run unit tests with coverage, generating both XML coverage and JUnit test reports before submitting code analysis. Specified Python 3.12 in the SonarQube configuration for more accurate analysis. Added token file to `.gitignore` for security. Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/sonarqube_setup_complete.md` detailing the SonarQube configuration, scripts, and usage patterns. Successfully tested the complete workflow by running an analysis with coverage metrics and verifying results in the SonarQube dashboard. Verified full API functionality through direct token-based API calls that confirmed proper project registration and metric collection. Initial analysis reported 34.3% code coverage from unit tests, 6,321 lines of code, 5 bugs, 47 code smells, and 0 vulnerabilities.

- **Added Terraform Monitoring Configuration (PR #158)**: Introduced Terraform support for infrastructure management, particularly for setting up monitoring resources. Added DevContainer integration, pre-commit validation, Terraform configuration files, deployment scripts, and comprehensive documentation. This implementation replaces the older script-based approach with a more robust, version-controlled solution that creates log-based metrics and a comprehensive monitoring dashboard in Google Cloud Console.

- **Enhanced Google Cloud Logging**: Significantly improved the logging system with structured logging capabilities, request context tracking, performance monitoring, and error classification. Created a provider-agnostic architecture with specialized middleware for API request tracking. Added the `nyc_landmarks/utils/request_context.py` module for request context propagation, enhanced the existing logger with JSON formatting and context-aware logging, and implemented a demonstration script in `scripts/demonstrate_logging.py`. Integrated these enhancements with the FastAPI application through middleware components. Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/google_cloud_logging_enhancements.md` detailing the new capabilities, query examples, and usage patterns.

- **Implemented PR #154 - Wikipedia API Improvements**: Implemented Phase 1 "Quick Wins" of the Wikipedia API Improvement project, focusing on enhancing performance, reliability, and efficiency of API calls. Key improvements include: (1) Connection pooling with `requests.Session()`, (2) Enhanced timeout handling with separate connect and read timeouts, (3) Improved error handling with better categorization and detailed logging, (4) Metadata caching to avoid redundant collection, and (5) Tenacity-based retry mechanism with exponential backoff. Added the test script `scripts/test_wikipedia_improvements.py` to validate these improvements.

- **Implemented PR #149 - Thread-Local Optimization for WikipediaProcessor**: Enhanced the parallel processing capabilities in `scripts/ci/process_wikipedia_articles.py` by implementing thread-local storage for `WikipediaProcessor` instances. Added the `_get_processor()` helper function to manage thread-local instances, ensuring each thread reuses a single processor instance rather than creating new ones for each landmark. This optimization reduces overhead and improves performance in multi-threaded environments, particularly for large-scale processing jobs.

- **Reviewed PR #148 - Workflow Parameter Cleanup**: Analyzed the GitHub workflow file `.github/workflows/process_wikipedia.yml` and identified unused parameters that can be safely removed. Specifically, the `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` parameters are defined in the workflow inputs and passed to the processing script, but the script itself doesn't accept these parameters in its argument parser. The `WikipediaProcessor` class likely handles text chunking internally with default values or configuration elsewhere. Removing these parameters will make the workflow file more accurate without affecting functionality.

- **Improved Landmark Metrics Concurrency**: Implemented parallel processing in `scripts/fetch_landmark_reports.py` for both Wikipedia article count fetching and PDF index status checking using ThreadPoolExecutor. This enhancement replaces sequential processing with concurrent execution, significantly improving performance for large datasets by allowing multiple requests to be processed simultaneously.

- **Completed Wikipedia Processing Refactoring**: Successfully refactored the large `scripts/ci/process_wikipedia_articles.py` script (757 lines) to use the modular `WikipediaProcessor` class. The main script now focuses on orchestration logic, command-line argument handling, and results reporting while delegating core Wikipedia processing functionality to the dedicated `WikipediaProcessor` class.

- **Enhanced Vector Query Capabilities in PineconeDB**: Significantly improved the vector database query functionality with enhanced filtering options, better namespace handling, and more robust error recovery. Consolidated multiple query methods into a single, more powerful `query_vectors` method with comprehensive options for different use cases.

- **Enhanced Vector Utility Tool**: Extensively improved the `scripts/vector_utility.py` tool with comprehensive capabilities for vector inspection, validation, and comparison. Added robust handling of different building metadata formats and better formatting for displaying vector information.

- **Implemented flattened building metadata**: Refactored the building metadata storage approach from nested arrays to flattened key-value pairs (e.g., `building_0_name`, `building_0_address`) to ensure compatibility with Pinecone's metadata constraints and enable filtering by building attributes. Created the `_flatten_buildings_metadata` method in the `EnhancedMetadataCollector` class and updated dependent code in PineconeDB and WikipediaProcessor to handle the new format while preserving all building information. Added support for `building_names` array field for simplified filtering by building name.

- **Added Wikipedia article quality assessment and filtering**: Implemented integration with the Wikimedia Lift Wing articlequality API to assess the quality of Wikipedia articles (FA, GA, B, C, Start, Stub). This data is stored in article metadata and propagated to vector chunks for improved search filtering and ranking. Quality assessment includes quality level, confidence scores, and human-readable descriptions. The system now filters out low-quality articles (Stub and Start classifications) early in the processing pipeline to improve the overall quality of the vector database.

- **Added Wikipedia revision ID tracking**: Enhanced the Wikipedia fetcher and processor to track article revision IDs, providing better versioning and citation support for all Wikipedia content. This revision ID is now consistently propagated through the entire pipeline from fetching to storage in the vector database.

- **Fixed return type in `WikipediaFetcher.fetch_wikipedia_content`**: Updated the method to consistently return a tuple of (content, rev_id) for better error handling and type consistency.

- **Enhanced metadata in Wikipedia chunks**: Included revision IDs in chunk metadata to enable precise article version tracking for citations and updates.

- **Successfully implemented `nyc_landmarks/wikipedia/processor.py`**: Created the `WikipediaProcessor` class as planned in Phase 1 of the refactoring project, extracting core Wikipedia processing functionality from the main script.

- **Created Wikipedia package structure**: Established `nyc_landmarks/wikipedia/` directory with proper module organization.

- **Developed custom Wikipedia analysis script**: Implemented `scripts/analyze_wikipedia_article.py` to analyze individual Wikipedia articles and extract potential metadata attributes.

- **Added landmarks processing module**: Created `nyc_landmarks/landmarks/landmarks_processing.py` to support the refactoring effort.

- **Enhanced results reporting**: Added `nyc_landmarks/utils/results_reporter.py` for better statistics and reporting capabilities.

- **Created API Enhancement Analysis Script**: Added `scripts/analyze_api_enhancements.py` to test underutilized CoreDataStore APIs for Phase 2 of the Wikipedia refactoring project.

- **Fixed Package Version Synchronization Workflow**: Implemented `scripts/ci/sync_versions.sh` and updated GitHub Actions workflow to automatically sync package versions between requirements.txt and setup.py for Dependabot PRs.

- **Simplified Building Metadata Integration**: Refactored `EnhancedMetadataCollector._add_building_data` method to remove redundant direct API calls and rely solely on the DbClient method, which already calls the same CoreDataStore API endpoint. This simplifies the code, removes duplication, and maintains all functionality.

- **Documented Building Metadata Integration**: Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/building_metadata_integration.md` explaining the implementation, known issues with field mapping, and potential future improvements.

- **Tested Building Metadata Integration**: Successfully tested the updated implementation with `scripts/test_building_metadata.py` and identified a field mapping issue where some building data fields aren't properly preserved during model conversion.

- **Enhanced Building Data Display in Vector Utility**: Improved the `process_building_data` function in `scripts/vector_utility.py` to better handle building data in vector metadata, including handling for empty arrays, non-dictionary data types, and more robust detection of missing data. This allows for consistent display of building information across various data formats.
