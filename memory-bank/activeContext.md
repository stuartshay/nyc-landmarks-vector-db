# Active Context: NYC Landmarks Vector Database

## Current Focus
- Fixing issues with the Pinecone vector database after a failed GitHub Action
- Diagnosing and resolving missing embeddings in the existing index
- Creating tests to verify null metadata handling
- Implementing regeneration of the Pinecone index

## Recent Changes
1. Created `test_pinecone_null_metadata.py` with two integration tests:
   - `test_pinecone_null_metadata_handling` - Tests standard metadata filtering
   - `test_wikipedia_null_metadata_handling` - Tests Wikipedia-specific metadata filtering
2. Both tests verify that null values in metadata are properly filtered out before being sent to Pinecone
3. The tests confirmed our fix is working properly at the code level

## Current Issues
1. Running `verify_vectors.py` revealed that all vectors in the index are missing their embeddings:
   ```
   Valid ID format: 100/100 (100.00%)
   Valid embeddings: 0/100 (0.00%)
   Valid metadata: 100/100 (100.00%)
   ```
2. The regenerate_pinecone_index.py script verified all 16,200 vectors have standardized ID format
3. The core issue appears to be in the vector storage process during GitHub Actions, where embeddings are not being stored properly

## Next Steps
1. Need to completely rebuild the Pinecone index using `regenerate_pinecone_index.py` with the `--recreate` flag
2. Process raw landmark data and Wikipedia articles with proper embeddings
3. Verify the rebuilt index with `verify_vectors.py` to ensure embeddings are present
4. Update progress documentation once the index is successfully rebuilt

## Decisions
- Created comprehensive tests for null metadata handling before rebuilding the index
- Determined the primary issue is missing embeddings, not metadata handling
- Decided to use the existing regeneration script rather than creating a new process
