# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on enhancing the NYC Landmarks project by extracting additional metadata from Wikipedia articles about landmarks. This involves analyzing the Wikipedia content processing pipeline and identifying potential attributes that can enrich the metadata in the vector database.

## Recent Changes

- Successfully ran the Wikipedia processing script for 25 landmarks, which extracted and embedded content from various Wikipedia articles.
- Created a custom analysis script (`scripts/analyze_wikipedia_article.py`) to fetch, analyze, and extract metadata attributes from Wikipedia articles.
- Generated dumps of Wikipedia article content and metadata in the `logs/wikipedia_analysis` directory.
- Identified additional metadata fields that could be extracted from Wikipedia content to enhance landmark data.
- Created a detailed metadata analysis report outlining current extraction capabilities, challenges, and recommendations for improvement.

## Next Steps

### Wikipedia Metadata Enhancement

1. Integrate the recommended metadata fields into the Wikipedia processing pipeline
1. Improve extraction patterns to handle context-dependent information
1. Consider implementing named entity recognition for better metadata extraction
1. Develop a validation mechanism for extracted metadata

### Vector DB Integration

1. Update the vector DB schema to incorporate the new metadata fields
1. Modify the metadata validators to handle the new fields
1. Enhance query capabilities to leverage the additional metadata

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Metadata Extraction Approach

- Currently using regex-based extraction for metadata, which works for simple patterns but has limitations with context-dependent information.
- Need to decide whether to enhance regex patterns or implement more sophisticated NLP techniques.

### Data Quality Management

- Considering a human-in-the-loop approach for validating extracted metadata before adding to production.
- Need to establish data quality metrics for the extracted metadata.

### Processing Pipeline Improvements

- The current Wikipedia processing approach fetches entire articles, but some landmarks have sections of larger articles.
- Need to determine if we should extract only relevant sections or process entire articles.

## Current Challenges

- Accuracy of metadata extraction requires improvement, particularly for complex fields like architectural styles.
- Some Wikipedia articles contain ambiguous information that requires contextual understanding.
- Need to balance the breadth of metadata extraction with precision.
