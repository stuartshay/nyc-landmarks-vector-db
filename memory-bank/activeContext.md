# Active Context

## Current Focus

**COMPLETED:** Successfully fixed all failing tests in `tests/unit/test_db_client_edge_cases.py` by adding missing helper methods to the `DbClient` class. All 17 tests now pass.

## Recent Changes

### DB Client Edge Case Tests Fix - Complete (2025-05-27)

Successfully resolved all failing tests in the DB client edge cases test suite by implementing missing helper methods:

#### Problem Identified

- 5 tests were failing with `AttributeError` for missing methods `_fetch_buildings_from_client` and `_fetch_buildings_from_landmark_detail`
- Tests expected these private helper methods to exist in the `DbClient` class
- These methods were referenced in other test files but were missing from the actual implementation

#### Solution Implemented

Added two missing helper methods to `nyc_landmarks/db/db_client.py`:

1. **`_fetch_buildings_from_client()`**:

   - Attempts to fetch buildings using the client's `get_landmark_buildings` method
   - Returns empty list if method doesn't exist or fails
   - Includes proper error handling and logging
   - Uses type casting to ensure compatibility with union types

1. **`_fetch_buildings_from_landmark_detail()`**:

   - Fetches buildings from landmark detail response as fallback
   - Validates response type and attributes before processing
   - Filters out invalid items and respects limit parameter
   - Robust error handling for various edge cases

1. **Enhanced `get_landmark_buildings()`**:

   - Now uses both helper methods in sequence (primary + fallback)
   - Standardizes landmark ID format
   - Converts all items to `LpcReportModel` objects
   - Maintains existing public interface while adding internal robustness

#### Technical Details

- **Type Safety**: Added proper type casting using `cast()` to resolve mypy errors
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with detailed logging
- **Fallback Logic**: Primary method tries client API, fallback uses landmark detail response
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Handles missing methods, invalid responses, and malformed data
- **Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

#### Test Results

- **Before**: 5 failed, 12 passed (17 total)
- **After**: 17 passed (100% success rate)

All edge case scenarios now properly tested including:

- Missing API methods (hasattr checks)
- Invalid response types
- Missing attributes in responses
- Exception handling
- Empty result scenarios

### Previous Work - fetch_landmark_reports.py Enhancement & Testing - Complete (2025-05-26)

Successfully refactored and enhanced the landmark reports fetching script with comprehensive functionality and created a complete test suite:

#### Key Improvements

1. **Complete DbClient Integration**

   - Replaced custom `CoreDataStoreClient` with unified `DbClient` interface
   - Eliminated ~100 lines of duplicated API client code
   - Uses proper Pydantic models (`LpcReportResponse`, `LpcReportModel`)
   - Consistent error handling and logging with project standards

1. **Enhanced Pagination and Data Processing**

   - Implemented `get_total_record_count()` to determine dataset size
   - Intelligent pagination that fetches all records or respects limits
   - Progress tracking with verbose logging options
   - Robust error handling with retry logic and safety limits

1. **Comprehensive Filtering Support**

   - Borough filtering (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island)
   - Object type filtering (Individual Landmark, Historic District, etc.)
   - Neighborhood-based filtering
   - Text search capabilities
   - Architectural style filtering
   - Sorting by column with ascending/descending options

1. **Professional Documentation and CLI**

   - Complete module docstring with 20+ usage examples
   - Comprehensive argument parser with all filtering options
   - Help text and examples built into CLI
   - Dry-run capability for testing filters
   - Single-page fetching for targeted operations

1. **Enhanced Output and Metrics**

   - Processing metrics with timing and error tracking
   - Timestamped JSON output files
   - PDF URL extraction with metadata
   - Sample PDF downloading with progress tracking
   - Detailed processing summaries

#### Technical Implementation

- **Class Design**: `LandmarkReportProcessor` with clean separation of concerns
- **Data Models**: `ProcessingMetrics` and `ProcessingResult` for structured output
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints using dataclasses with `field(default_factory=list)`
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with detailed logging and graceful degradation
- **Performance**: Configurable page sizes and intelligent record counting

#### Test Results

Created a complete test suite with **20 test cases** covering all functionality. All tests pass successfully.

### Previous Work - PineconeDB Enhancement - Phase 1 Complete (2025-05-25)

Successfully enhanced the `PineconeDB` class with four new methods to consolidate functionality from `scripts/vector_utility.py`:

1. **`fetch_vector_by_id()`** - Consolidated vector fetching logic
1. **`list_vectors_with_filter()`** - Enhanced vector listing with prefix filtering
1. **`query_vectors_by_landmark()`** - Landmark-specific vector queries
1. **`validate_vector_metadata()`** - Comprehensive vector validation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Test Infrastructure Robustness**: The DB client edge case tests demonstrate the importance of comprehensive test coverage for edge cases and error scenarios. The missing helper methods were caught by thorough testing.

1. **Helper Method Design**: Private helper methods should follow established patterns:

   - Proper error handling with logging
   - Type safety with appropriate casting
   - Graceful degradation for missing functionality
   - Clear parameter validation

1. **Test-Driven Development**: This fix shows the value of having tests that exercise edge cases - they catch missing implementations and ensure robustness.

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Vector Utility Script Refactoring

With the DB client tests now fully passing, continue the PineconeDB consolidation work:

1. **Replace duplicated functions** in `scripts/vector_utility.py`:

   - Replace `_setup_pinecone_client()` with direct `PineconeDB` instantiation
   - Replace `fetch_vector()` with `PineconeDB.fetch_vector_by_id()`
   - Replace `query_landmark_vectors()` with `PineconeDB.query_vectors_by_landmark()`
   - Replace `list_vectors()` logic with `PineconeDB.list_vectors_with_filter()`
   - Replace validation functions with `PineconeDB.validate_vector_metadata()`

1. **Apply Documentation Standards**: Update vector_utility.py with comprehensive documentation following established patterns

### Expected Benefits from Completed Work

- **Test Reliability**: All DB client edge cases now properly tested and handled
- **Code Robustness**: Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Type Safety**: Proper type casting resolves static analysis warnings
- **Maintainability**: Clear helper method patterns for future development
- **Quality Assurance**: 100% test success rate ensures regression protection
