# DevContainer Test Workflow Fix

## Issue Description

The GitHub Actions workflow `test-devcontainer.yml` was failing on the `test-post-create-script` job, specifically in the "Test virtual environment setup" step. The job was failing because the virtual environment `.venv` was not being found.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was identified as a **container persistence problem**:

1. **Original Problem**: Each test step in the workflow was running in a separate `docker run --rm` command
1. **Impact**: The `--rm` flag removes the container after each run, so the `.venv` created in one step wasn't available in the next step
1. **Specific Failure**: The post-create script would run and create `.venv`, but when the next test tried to check for `.venv`, it was running in a fresh container without the virtual environment

## Solution Implemented

### Consolidated Test Steps

Replaced multiple separate test steps with a single comprehensive test that runs all validations in one container instance:

```yaml
- name: Test comprehensive environment setup
  run: |
    docker run --rm \
      -v "${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}":/workspaces/nyc-landmarks-vector-db \
      -w /workspaces/nyc-landmarks-vector-db \
      test-post-create:latest \
      bash -c "
        # All tests run in single container instance
        # 1. Run post-create script
        # 2. Test virtual environment creation
        # 3. Test package installations
        # 4. Test project package
        # 5. Test pre-commit hooks
      "
```

### Test Coverage

The consolidated test now validates:

1. **Post-create Script Execution**

   - Runs the complete script
   - Validates successful completion

1. **Virtual Environment Setup**

   - Verifies `.venv` directory creation
   - Tests virtual environment activation
   - Validates Python and pip availability

1. **Package Installation Verification**

   - Development tools (pytest, black, isort, mypy, flake8)
   - Data science packages (pinecone, numpy, pandas)
   - Web framework packages (fastapi, uvicorn)
   - Pre-commit package

1. **Project Package Installation**

   - Tests importability of `nyc_landmarks` module
   - Verifies development mode installation

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**

   - Validates hook installation
   - Tests pre-commit command availability
   - Checks environment initialization (optional)
   - Tests basic pre-commit execution

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Reliability**: Tests now run in a single container context, ensuring persistence
1. **Efficiency**: Reduced container creation overhead
1. **Better Output**: Clearer test progression with section headers
1. **Comprehensive**: All post-create functionality tested in one place
1. **Debugging**: Easier to debug issues since all steps are in one execution context

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/test-devcontainer.yml`: Consolidated test steps
- `memory-bank/devcontainer-test-workflow-fix.md`: This documentation

## Validation

- ✅ YAML syntax validated
- ✅ Bash script syntax validated
- ✅ Workflow structure verified
- ✅ Container persistence issue resolved

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding more granular failure detection
1. Potentially add timing measurements for performance monitoring
1. Could add artifact collection for debugging if needed
