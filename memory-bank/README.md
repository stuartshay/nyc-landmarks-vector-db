# Memory Bank

This directory serves as a centralized location for project documentation, research notes, implementation details, and improvement records that are relevant to the project's development and maintenance.

## Purpose

The Memory Bank helps developers understand project decisions, track improvements, and maintain institutional knowledge even as team members change over time. Think of it as the project's "brain" that retains important information.

## What to Store Here

- **Implementation details** - Technical decisions and architecture overviews
- **Improvement records** - Documentation of significant improvements or refactorings
- **Research notes** - Findings from research that influenced project decisions
- **Design patterns** - Notable design patterns used in the project
- **Performance optimizations** - Details about performance improvements
- **Test strategies** - Approaches to testing different components
- **Deployment guides** - Specialized deployment procedures
- **Troubleshooting guides** - Solutions to common issues

## What NOT to Store Here

- **Code** - Code belongs in the appropriate source directories
- **Configuration files** - These belong in their respective locations
- **Personal notes** - Information not relevant to the project
- **Duplicate documentation** - Don't duplicate what's in the main README or inline docstrings

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive kebab-case names for files:
- `test-improvements.md`
- `vector-storage-architecture.md`
- `api-design.md`

## Format

- Use Markdown format (`.md`) for all documentation
- Include a clear title and date at the top of each document
- Organize content with appropriate headings (H1, H2, H3)
- Update existing documents rather than creating duplicates when possible

## Organization

As the memory bank grows, consider organizing files into subdirectories by category (e.g., `architecture/`, `research/`, `improvements/`).
