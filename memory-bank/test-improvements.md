# Test Suite Improvements

## Summary of Changes (May 3, 2025)

### Fixed Issues
1. **Resolved unknown pytest mark warnings**
   - Created a `conftest.py` file to automatically apply markers based on test directory structure
   - This ensures all tests are properly marked without requiring explicit decorators in each test file

2. **Fixed asyncio warnings**
   - Updated `pytest.ini` to specify `asyncio_mode` and `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope`
   - This prevents warnings from pytest-asyncio about unset configuration options

3. **Improved Python environment configuration**
   - Added environment variables in `.env` file for Python paths
   - Updated VS Code settings to use these environment variables
   - This makes it easier to switch between different Python environments

4. **Enhanced test resilience**
   - Improved fallback mechanisms for tests that rely on external APIs
   - Added proper mock data support in the test utilities

5. **Added dependency management documentation**
   - Updated CONTRIBUTING.md with clear instructions on how to manage dependencies
   - Added pytest-dotenv to setup.py to ensure consistent environment loading in tests

### Benefits

1. **More reliable tests**: Tests now work consistently even when external APIs are unavailable
2. **Cleaner test output**: No more warnings when running the test suite
3. **Better developer experience**: Clear guidelines for adding dependencies and managing the environment
4. **Enhanced maintainability**: Automatic test marking based on directory structure simplifies test organization

### Next Steps

1. **Test Documentation**: Consider expanding the test documentation to explain the different test categories
2. **Mock Data**: Continue improving mock data coverage for more comprehensive offline testing
3. **CI Integration**: Ensure CI pipelines use the same environment configuration as local development
