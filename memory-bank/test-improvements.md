# Test Suite Improvements

## Summary of Changes (May 3, 2025)

### Fixed Issues

1. **Resolved unknown pytest mark warnings**

   - Created a `conftest.py` file to automatically apply markers based on test directory
     structure
   - This ensures all tests are properly marked without requiring explicit decorators in
     each test file

1. **Fixed asyncio warnings**

   - Updated `pytest.ini` to specify `asyncio_mode` and
     `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope`
   - This prevents warnings from pytest-asyncio about unset configuration options

1. **Improved Python environment configuration**

   - Added environment variables in `.env` file for Python paths
   - Updated VS Code settings to use these environment variables
   - This makes it easier to switch between different Python environments

1. **Enhanced test resilience**

   - Improved fallback mechanisms for tests that rely on external APIs
   - Added proper mock data support in the test utilities

1. **Added dependency management documentation**

   - Updated CONTRIBUTING.md with clear instructions on how to manage dependencies
   - Added pytest-dotenv to setup.py to ensure consistent environment loading in tests

### Benefits

1. **More reliable tests**: Tests now work consistently even when external APIs are
   unavailable
1. **Cleaner test output**: No more warnings when running the test suite
1. **Better developer experience**: Clear guidelines for adding dependencies and
   managing the environment
1. **Enhanced maintainability**: Automatic test marking based on directory structure
   simplifies test organization

### Next Steps

1. **Test Documentation**: Consider expanding the test documentation to explain the
   different test categories
1. **Mock Data**: Continue improving mock data coverage for more comprehensive offline
   testing
1. **CI Integration**: Ensure CI pipelines use the same environment configuration as
   local development

## Vector Storage Pipeline Test Refactoring (May 12, 2025)

### Original Issue

The test function `test_vector_storage_pipeline` in
`tests/functional/test_vector_storage_pipeline.py` was flagged by McCabe complexity
analysis as too complex (21), exceeding the recommended threshold of 10. This made the
test difficult to understand, maintain, and debug.

### Improvement Details

The test was refactored by:

1. Breaking down the complex test function into smaller, single-responsibility helper
   functions:

   - `_setup_test_components`: Initialize all necessary components
   - `_fetch_landmark_data`: Get landmark data from API or mock
   - `_resolve_pdf_url`: Determine PDF URL for the landmark
   - `_download_pdf_file`: Download the PDF file to temp directory
   - `_process_pdf_text`: Extract text from PDF and save
   - `_chunk_and_enrich_text`: Chunk text and add metadata
   - `_create_embeddings`: Generate embeddings for the chunks
   - `_store_vectors_in_db`: Store vectors in Pinecone
   - `_verify_vector_count`: Verify vectors were stored by count check
   - `_query_and_verify_vectors`: Query the database and verify retrieval
   - `_cleanup_test_vectors`: Clean up test vectors

1. Adding proper type hints to make the code more robust

1. Improving documentation with clear function descriptions

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Readability**: Each function has a single, clear responsibility
- **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller functions are easier to update and fix
- **Better Testing**: Potential to test individual steps separately in the future
- **Improved Documentation**: Clearer documentation of what each step does
- **Reduced Complexity**: McCabe complexity reduced to well under the threshold

### Future Considerations

- We could further improve the test by making the helper functions more reusable across
  other tests
- The landmark ID is hardcoded; we might want to parameterize it to test with different
  landmarks
- Consider adding specific unit tests for these helper functions if they become more
  complex
