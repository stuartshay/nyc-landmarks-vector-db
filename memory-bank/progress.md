## Recent Accomplishments

### 2025-05-28: fetch_landmark_reports.py Script Review & Enhancement Planning - Complete ✅

- **Comprehensive Script Assessment**: Conducted thorough review of `scripts/fetch_landmark_reports.py` and confirmed excellent engineering practices
- **Enhancement Opportunity Analysis**: Identified 24 specific enhancement opportunities across 6 categories (Performance, Data Quality, Reporting, Configuration, Export Formats, Monitoring)
- **Implementation Priority Framework**: Established three-tier priority system (High Value/Low Effort, Medium Value/Medium Effort, High Value/High Effort) with specific recommendations
- **Memory Bank Documentation**: Added detailed enhancement roadmap to `memory-bank/research_items.md` with implementation complexity assessments and technical considerations
- **Current Script Strengths Validated**: Confirmed clean architecture, comprehensive type hints, DbClient integration, Wikipedia/PDF index capabilities, Excel export, and extensive CLI documentation

### 2025-05-27: Test Suite Cleanup - Complete ✅

- **Obsolete Test Removal**: Removed `tests/integration/test_landmark_fetcher_integration.py` which was testing the deprecated `LandmarkReportFetcher` class
- **Testing Consolidation**: The functionality is now comprehensively covered by the 20 unit tests in `tests/scripts/test_fetch_landmark_reports.py`
- **Documentation Update**: Updated memory bank to reflect the cleanup and maintain accurate project state documentation

### 2025-05-26: Script Enhancement - fetch_landmark_reports.py - Complete ✅

- **DbClient Integration**: Successfully replaced custom CoreDataStoreClient with unified DbClient interface
- **Comprehensive Pagination**: Implemented get_total_record_count() and intelligent page-through-all-records functionality
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Added support for borough, object_type, neighborhood, search_text, and architectural style filtering
- **Professional Documentation**: Complete module docstring with 20+ usage examples and comprehensive CLI help
- **Best Practices Implementation**: Type hints, dataclasses, proper error handling, and project logging standards
- **Performance Optimization**: Configurable page sizes, progress tracking, and intelligent record counting
- **Output Enhancement**: Timestamped JSON files, processing metrics, and PDF URL extraction

## Recent Improvements

### 2025-05-23: Notebook UI Enhancement

- Fixed pagination layout in `wikipedia_integration_testing.ipynb`
- Improved usability by placing pager on top and reorganizing controls
- Created a reusable pattern for widget organization that can be applied to other notebooks
- Developed a script to automate notebook cell modifications for standardization

### Previous Updates

- Standardized vector ID format across the system
- Improved error handling in database client
- Enhanced type checking for better code reliability
- Created comprehensive test suite for database operations
- Added Wikipedia article integration to enrich landmark data

## What's Left to Build

### Short-term Tasks

- Standardize pagination widget layout across all notebooks
- Create helper functions for common widget patterns
- Test notebooks in various environments to ensure consistent rendering
- Review and update notebook documentation standards

### Medium-term Tasks

- Improve performance of vector querying for large datasets
- Enhance Wikipedia content processing for better semantic search
- Develop more sophisticated vector filtering options
- Create advanced visualization tools for data exploration

### Long-term Goals

- Develop a web-based frontend for easier access to the data
- Implement user authentication and permission system
- Create automated data refresh pipelines
- Build a comprehensive dashboard for system monitoring

## Known Issues

- Some Jupyter notebook compatibility issues with VS Code
- Potential performance bottlenecks with large datasets
- Wikipedia article coverage is incomplete for some landmarks
- Test suite occasionally encounters timeout issues with API calls
