## Current Status
The project is in the initial setup and infrastructure development phase. We have completed the following:

- ✅ Created project documentation in memory bank
- ✅ Defined system architecture and core components
- ✅ Identified technical requirements and constraints
- ✅ Implemented CoreDataStore API client for landmark data access
- ✅ Decided to use CoreDataStore API exclusively as the data source

- ✅ Implemented integration tests using actual API data
- ✅ Added integration tests that utilize the CoreDataStore MCP server
- ✅ Set up VS Code test configuration for pytest
- ✅ Refactored scripts to use Pydantic models for validation
- ✅ Created a basic vector search testing notebook to form the foundation of the Query API Enhancement
- ✅ Established notebook standardization by removing duplicates and fixing compatibility issues
- ✅ Implemented a consolidated notebook execution system with `run_all_notebooks.py` script that offers:
  - Single or batch notebook execution
  - Configurable output directory
  - Cell execution timeout options
  - Execution summary reporting
- ✅ Created dedicated `test_output/notebooks` directory for executed notebooks (excluded from git)
- ✅ Verified that all current notebooks execute successfully with proper output
- ✅ Added nbstripout pre-commit hook to automatically clear notebook outputs before committing
- ✅ Added nbQA pre-commit hooks to enforce consistent style and quality in notebook code cells
- ✅ Established comprehensive notebook standards for structure, documentation, and code quality
- ✅ Updated project dependencies to include notebook linting and output management tools
- ✅ Enhanced PineconeDB implementation with deterministic vector IDs to prevent duplicates when reprocessing landmarks
- ✅ Added integration tests to verify proper fixed ID functionality and backward compatibility
- ✅ Added metadata consistency verification to the test suite to ensure proper data integrity
- ✅ Created standalone verification script (`verify_pinecone_fixed_ids.py`) for manual vector database validation
- ✅ Implemented reusable verification components in `tests/verification/test_pinecone_fixed_ids.py`
- ✅ Added comprehensive integration tests in `tests/integration/test_pinecone_validation.py` for automated validation
- ✅ Updated project dependencies in setup.py and requirements.txt to latest stable versions

## What Works
- ✅ Comprehensive CoreDataStore API client implementation
- ✅ Basic configuration management for API credentials and settings
- ✅ Extended landmark data access capabilities via CoreDataStore API tools
- ✅ MCP server integration for direct API interactions
- ✅ Pydantic models for proper data validation
- ✅ Unit and integration testing infrastructure
- ✅ Test discovery and execution in VS Code
- ✅ Pydantic-based data validation in scripts
- ✅ Scalable batch processing workflow for landmarks via GitHub Actions (`process_landmarks.yml`).
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline now builds a Docker image with all dependencies in a single job, pushes it to GitHub Container Registry, and runs all parallel jobs using this pre-built image for maximum efficiency and reproducibility.
- ✅ Created a Dockerfile at the repository root to enable Docker image builds in CI/CD. This resolves the previous workflow failure due to a missing Dockerfile.
- ✅ Comprehensive Jupyter notebook for analyzing Pinecone vector database statistics (`pinecone_db_stats.ipynb`)
- ✅ Basic vector search testing with `landmark_query_testing.ipynb` notebook, including query execution, filtering, and performance metrics
- ✅ Standardized notebook management to maintain only the latest versions with successful execution outputs
- ✅ Implemented notebook execution validation using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute` to verify functionality
- ✅ Organized notebook outputs in a dedicated `test_output/notebooks` directory to keep repository clean
- ✅ Established a formal workflow for notebook execution with automated output saving
- ✅ Enhanced PineconeDB implementation with deterministic vector IDs to prevent duplicates when reprocessing landmarks
- ✅ Added integration tests to verify proper fixed ID functionality and backward compatibility
- ✅ Added metadata consistency verification to the test suite to ensure proper data integrity
- ✅ Vector database verification system with both standalone script and integrated test modules
- ✅ Implemented reusable verification components that can be used in both manual scripts and automated tests
- ✅ Created detailed validation for vector IDs and metadata consistency
- ✅ Updated to latest stable dependency versions for improved functionality and security

## Known Issues
- Pylance errors in the Pydantic models due to import issues (can be resolved with proper environment setup)
- Integration tests depend on CoreDataStore API being available
- MCP server tests need to be run in an environment with the server connected
- [RESOLVED] Previous CI/CD workflow failed due to missing Dockerfile. This has now been fixed.
- [RESOLVED] Fixed flake8 issues including unnecessary dict comprehension, unnecessary generators (set comprehensions), f-string with missing placeholders, and syntactic errors in coredatastore_api.py. The remaining complexity issues (C901) will require more extensive refactoring.
