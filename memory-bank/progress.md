# Progress - NYC Landmarks Vector Database

## What Works

- **PDF Processing Pipeline**: Completed and fully functional; processes landmark PDFs into chunks for vector storage
- **Landmark Status Tracking**: We can track the processing status of each landmark PDF document
- **Enhanced Vector Metadata**: Our vectors contain enriched metadata for more precise searching
- **Pinecone Vector DB Integration**: Successfully storing and querying vectors with proper namespacing
- **API Foundation**: Basic API structure is in place with endpoints for both querying and chat functionality
- **Vector ID Standardization**: Implemented consistent ID formats for both PDF and Wikipedia content
  - PDF vectors: `{landmark_id}-chunk-{chunk_num}`
  - Wikipedia vectors: `wiki-{article_title}-{landmark_id}-chunk-{chunk_num}`
- **Wikipedia Article Integration**: Extension to incorporate Wikipedia content related to landmarks
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Enhanced DbClient and related code with better type annotations and error handling
- **Development Tools Integration**: Integrated MCP servers for enhanced documentation access

## Recently Completed

1. **Type Safety Improvements**:
   - Fixed DbClient implementation to properly handle type conversions between dict and Pydantic models
   - Created proper type stub for `db_client.py` to satisfy mypy type checking
   - Enhanced error handling for dict-to-model conversions with safe fallbacks
   - Improved landmark buildings retrieval to ensure consistent return types
   - Refactored complex DbClient methods into smaller, focused helper methods for improved maintainability:
     - `_standardize_lp_number` to ensure consistent landmark ID formatting
     - `_fetch_buildings_from_client` to retrieve building data from the API
     - `_fetch_buildings_from_landmark_detail` as a fallback mechanism
     - `_convert_building_items_to_models` to ensure type-safe conversions
   - Fixed the Wikipedia article protocol method to return a valid empty list instead of None
   - Updated API documentation to reflect the improved design and type handling
   - Added robust error logging for conversion failures
   - Fixed mypy errors in the core DbClient functionality

2. **Vector ID Standardization**: Created a comprehensive script `scripts/regenerate_pinecone_index.py` that:
   - Backs up all vectors by source type (PDF, Wikipedia, or test)

7. **API Client Abstraction**: Improvements to the DbClient abstraction layer which:
   - Centralizes API interactions with the CoreDataStore API
   - Handles pagination and error handling for landmark data retrieval
   - Provides methods like `get_landmarks_page()` and `get_landmark_pdf_url()`
   - Now properly converts between dictionary and Pydantic model responses
   - Has enhanced type safety with proper error handling
   - Includes comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

8. **Development Tools Integration**: Implemented MCP server frameworks to enhance development workflow:
   - Installed and configured the Context7 MCP server for up-to-date library documentation
   - Set up the MCP configuration in `cline_mcp_settings.json` using GitHub repository URL format
   - Configured the server to use the npm package `@upstash/context7-mcp@latest`
   - Tested functionality by retrieving documentation for React hooks
   - Established a standardized approach for MCP server configuration and security settings

## Known Issues

- ‚úÖ Fixed: All vectors now have standardized ID formats (16,136 vectors in total)
- ‚úÖ Fixed: Integration tests now verify and pass with standardized vector ID format for all landmarks including LP-00001
- ‚úÖ Fixed: Pagination handling now uses proper path parameters instead of query parameters
- Several Pylance warnings about type annotations remain in the codebase despite mypy passing
- Some tests fail due to reliance on older model formats that lack required fields in the new models
- Certain API endpoints (e.g., those with 'A' suffix in landmark IDs) return 404 errors that need handling
- Pagination boundary errors (404 on pages 11-15) require graceful handling
