# NYC Landmarks Vector Database - Progress

## Current Status
The project is in the initial setup phase. We have completed the following:

- ✅ Created project documentation in memory bank
- ✅ Defined system architecture and core components
- ✅ Identified technical requirements and constraints
- ✅ Implemented CoreDataStore API client for landmark data access
- ✅ Created database abstraction layer to support multiple data sources
- ✅ Updated API endpoints to use the database abstraction

## What Works
- ✅ Database abstraction layer supporting both PostgreSQL and CoreDataStore API
- ✅ Basic configuration management with settings for toggling data sources
- ✅ Extended landmark data access capabilities through CoreDataStore API

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure
- [x] Set up project structure with appropriate directories
- [x] Create configuration management module
- [x] Set up connections to external services (PostgreSQL and CoreDataStore API)
- [x] Create database abstraction layer
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling and logging

### Phase 2: PDF Processing & Embedding Pipeline
- [ ] Implement PDF text extraction from Azure Blob Storage
- [ ] Develop text chunking and preprocessing functionality
- [ ] Set up connection to OpenAI API for embedding generation
- [ ] Create Pinecone index and implement vector storage
- [ ] Build batch processing system for embedding generation

### Phase 3: Query & Chat API Development
- [ ] Develop vector search functionality
- [ ] Create API endpoints for vector search
- [ ] Implement conversation memory system
- [ ] Build chat API with context awareness
- [ ] Add filtering by landmark ID

### Phase 4: Testing, Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Write unit tests for core components
- [ ] Create integration tests for end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Deploy initial version

## Known Issues
- No known issues yet as implementation hasn't started

## Performance Metrics
- No metrics yet as implementation hasn't started

## Next Major Milestones
1. **Project Structure & Configuration**: Complete basic project setup with configuration management
2. **PDF Processing Pipeline**: Implement text extraction and chunking
3. **Embedding Generation**: Set up OpenAI integration and generate embeddings
4. **Vector Storage**: Store embeddings in Pinecone with appropriate metadata
5. **Initial API**: Create basic vector search API endpoint
