# Project Progress

## What Works

### Core System Components

- Core landmark vector database is operational
- API endpoints for querying landmarks are functional
- PDF processing pipeline for extracting landmark information works reliably
- Wikipedia integration for extracting additional landmark information is functional
- Basic vector search capabilities are implemented and tested

### Recently Completed Features

- **Wikipedia Revision ID Tracking**: Enhanced Wikipedia fetcher and processor to track article revision IDs, providing better versioning and citation support. Revision IDs are now consistently propagated through the entire pipeline from fetching to vector database storage.
- **Type Consistency Improvements**: Fixed return type handling in WikipediaFetcher.fetch_wikipedia_content to consistently return a tuple of (content, rev_id) for better error handling and type safety.
- **Enhanced Metadata in Wikipedia Chunks**: Added revision IDs to chunk metadata for precise article version tracking for citations and provenance tracking.
- **Wikipedia Processor Refactoring**: Successfully extracted Wikipedia processing functionality into `nyc_landmarks/wikipedia/processor.py` with the `WikipediaProcessor` class
- **Wikipedia Package Structure**: Created proper module organization under `nyc_landmarks/wikipedia/`
- **Landmarks Processing Module**: Implemented `nyc_landmarks/landmarks/landmarks_processing.py` for enhanced landmark processing capabilities
- **Results Reporting Module**: Added `nyc_landmarks/utils/results_reporter.py` for better statistics and reporting
- **Wikipedia Analysis Script**: Created `scripts/analyze_wikipedia_article.py` for individual article analysis and metadata extraction
- **Modular Architecture**: Established foundation for the Wikipedia refactoring project with clear separation of concerns
- **API Enhancement Analysis Script**: Added `scripts/analyze_api_enhancements.py` for testing underutilized CoreDataStore APIs for metadata enhancement opportunities
- **Package Version Synchronization**: Created `scripts/ci/sync_versions.sh` and updated GitHub workflow to automatically keep requirements.txt and setup.py versions in sync on Dependabot PRs

## In Progress

### Wikipedia Refactoring Project (Phase 1)

- Completing extraction of utilities to `nyc_landmarks/wikipedia/utils.py`
- Finalizing the streamlined main script (`scripts/ci/process_wikipedia_articles.py`) to achieve target ~200 lines
- Testing refactored components to ensure functionality preservation
- Validating performance parity with original implementation

### Metadata Enhancement (Phase 2 Preparation)

- Preparing for comprehensive Wikipedia article analysis with 25 landmarks
- Planning integration tests for underutilized CoreDataStore APIs
- Designing metadata enhancement strategy for Wikipedia content

## What's Left to Build

### Wikipedia Refactoring Project Completion

- Complete `nyc_landmarks/wikipedia/utils.py` module with utility functions
- Finalize main script refactoring to achieve 60%+ size reduction (757 â†’ ~200 lines)
- Comprehensive testing of refactored components
- Performance validation and optimization

### Wikipedia & API Integration Analysis (Phase 2)

- Execute Wikipedia processing with refactored components on 25 landmarks
- Test underutilized CoreDataStore APIs:
  - Photo Archive API (`get_landmark_photos`)
  - PLUTO Data API (`get_landmark_pluto_data`)
  - Building Details API (`get_landmark_buildings`)
  - Reference Data APIs (neighborhoods, object types, boroughs)
- Generate comprehensive analysis dump file
- Create implementation recommendations based on API testing

### Enhanced Metadata Pipeline (Phase 3)

- Implement highest-value API integrations
- Create enhanced metadata schema incorporating new data sources
- Develop improved Wikipedia content extraction patterns
- Add faceted search capabilities using enhanced metadata
- Performance optimization for the integrated pipeline

### Documentation and Testing

- Update API documentation to reflect new metadata fields
- Create comprehensive test suite for refactored components
- Implement integration tests for enhanced metadata pipeline
- Document refactoring patterns and architecture decisions

## Known Issues

- **Original Script Dependencies**: Main script still needs to be updated to use refactored components
- **Metadata Extraction Accuracy**: Wikipedia regex-based extraction needs refinement for better precision
- **Performance Impact**: Need to measure and optimize performance impact of API integrations
- **Testing Coverage**: Refactored components need comprehensive test coverage before production use
