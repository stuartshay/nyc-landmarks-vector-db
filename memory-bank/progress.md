## Recently Completed

1. **Type Safety Improvements**:
   - Fixed DbClient implementation to properly handle type conversions between dict and Pydantic models
   - Created proper type stub for `db_client.py` to satisfy mypy type checking
   - Enhanced error handling for dict-to-model conversions with safe fallbacks
   - Improved landmark buildings retrieval to ensure consistent return types
   - Refactored complex DbClient methods into smaller, focused helper methods for improved maintainability:
     - `_standardize_lp_number` to ensure consistent landmark ID formatting
     - `_fetch_buildings_from_client` to retrieve building data from the API
     - `_fetch_buildings_from_landmark_detail` as a fallback mechanism
     - `_convert_building_items_to_models` to ensure type-safe conversions
   - Fixed the Wikipedia article protocol method to return a valid empty list instead of None
   - Updated API documentation to reflect the improved design and type handling
   - Added robust error logging for conversion failures
   - Fixed mypy errors in the core DbClient functionality

2. **Vector ID Standardization**: Created a comprehensive script `scripts/regenerate_pinecone_index.py` that:
   - Backs up all vectors by source type (PDF, Wikipedia, or test)
   - Standardizes vector IDs using deterministic format rules
   - Reimports vectors with standardized IDs
   - Includes verification and reporting capabilities

3. **Vector Verification Utilities**: Added tools to detect and report on inconsistent ID formats

4. **Landmark Processing Status Checks**: Enhanced with vector ID verification capabilities

5. **Memory Bank Documentation**: Updated to reflect vector ID standardization approach and progress

   - Updated Pydantic models in `nyc_landmarks/models/landmark_models.py` to match actual API responses
   - Created new Pydantic models for detailed landmark endpoint (`LpcReportDetailResponse`, `MapData`, `MapPoint`, etc.)
   - Updated next steps to include ensuring all API interaction code uses the new models

7. **CoreDataStore API Improvements**:
   - Added flexible landmark ID handling via the `_standardize_landmark_id` method to detect variant formats

8. **API Client Abstraction**: Improvements to the DbClient abstraction layer which:
   - Centralizes API interactions with the CoreDataStore API
   - Handles pagination and error handling for landmark data retrieval
   - Provides methods like `get_landmarks_page()` and `get_landmark_pdf_url()`
   - Now properly converts between dictionary and Pydantic model responses

11. **Pinecone Test Isolation Strategy**: Implemented a session-specific test index approach for Pinecone:
   - Created unique test indices with timestamp and random identifiers (e.g., `nyc-landmarks-test-20250510-223144-0nad0u`)
   - Developed enhanced `tests/utils/pinecone_test_utils.py` with utilities to create, manage, list, and clean up test indices
   - Added session-scoped fixtures in both `tests/integration/conftest.py` and `tests/functional/conftest.py`
   - Each test session gets its own isolated index to enable parallel test execution without conflicts
   - Enhanced `scripts/manage_test_index.py` utility script with new commands:
     - Create, reset, and delete specific test indices
     - List all existing test indices
     - Clean up old test indices based on age
   - Comprehensive documentation in `tests/README.md` explaining the session-specific index approach
   - Modified both integration and functional tests to use the test fixtures
   - Improved test synchronization with increased wait times (5 seconds instead of 2) to prevent timing-related failures
