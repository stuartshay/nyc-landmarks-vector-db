## Known Issues

- Some landmarks have minimal PDF content
- Embedding quality varies based on text content
- Wikipedia content may not always match landmarks perfectly
- Test coverage for edge cases needs expansion
- Large Wikipedia articles can exceed token limits for embedding models
  - Observed with The Ansonia (LP-00285) causing a 400 error due to the article's 11,091 tokens exceeding the model's 8,192 token limit
- Many landmarks don't have associated Wikipedia articles
  - Approximately 60% of landmarks tested on page 3 had no Wikipedia content
- Processing across multiple pages requires careful handling of limits to ensure a balanced workload

## Recent Completions

- **Enhanced Metadata Extraction for Wikipedia Articles**

  - Fixed missing metadata properties (`architect`, `neighborhood`, `style`) in Wikipedia article vector data
  - Modified `EnhancedMetadataCollector.collect_landmark_metadata` to explicitly extract these properties from landmark details
  - Modified the CoreDataStoreAPI client to prioritize the /api/LpcReport endpoint which provides more complete data
  - Implemented dual extraction approach for both dictionary and object types to ensure compatibility across different response formats
  - Added logging to confirm successful extraction of previously missing properties
  - Verified the fix by processing landmark LP-00009 and confirmed field values in Pinecone vector:
    - `architect: "Unknown"`
    - `neighborhood: "Greenwich Village"`
    - `style: "Italianate"`
