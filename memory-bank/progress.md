# Progress: NYC Landmarks Vector Database

## Achievements

### Core System
- ✅ Created comprehensive pipeline for processing landmark PDFs into vector embeddings
- ✅ Implemented vector search API with customizable filtering
- ✅ Added Wikipedia integration to enhance landmark information
- ✅ Designed test framework for Pinecone integration
- ✅ Created notebook for querying and analyzing vector database
- ✅ Implemented null metadata filtering in vector storage to prevent 400 errors
- ✅ Added tests for null metadata handling

### Testing
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite for Pinecone operations
- ✅ Implemented test-specific index creation for isolation
- ✅ Added integration tests for fixed ID implementation
- ✅ Added verification scripts for database integrity
- ✅ Created metadata consistency tests
- ✅ Implemented null metadata handling tests

## In Progress

### Pinecone Index Issues
- 🔄 Resolving issues with missing embeddings in Pinecone index
- 🔄 Need to completely rebuild the index due to missing embeddings (0% valid)
- 🔄 ID format is correct (100% standardized), but embeddings are missing

### Data Processing
- 🔄 Regenerating vector database with proper embeddings
- 🔄 Verifying vector integrity post-regeneration

## Upcoming Tasks

### System Improvements
- 📋 Complete index regeneration with proper embeddings
- 📋 Verify embeddings are correctly stored
- 📋 Update GitHub Actions workflow to prevent similar issues
- 📋 Add better error handling for embedding generation during CI/CD

### Documentation
- 📋 Document the index regeneration process
- 📋 Update API documentation with recent changes

## Known Issues
- ⚠️ All vectors in Pinecone index are missing their embeddings (0% valid)
- ⚠️ Current index is unusable for vector search due to missing embeddings

## Upcoming Milestones
1. Complete index regeneration with proper embeddings
2. Verify system end-to-end functionality
3. Test vector search performance with full dataset
