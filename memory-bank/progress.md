# Project Progress

## What Works

- **Core Data Store API Integration**
  - Landmark data fetching from NYC LPC API
  - Paginated requests with rate limiting
  - Error handling for API failures
  - Type-safe responses with Pydantic models

- **PDF Processing Pipeline**
  - PDF downloading and text extraction
  - Text chunking with token-based sizing
  - Embedding generation with OpenAI API
  - Storage in vector database

- **Vector Database Integration**
  - Pinecone index configuration and management
  - Vector storage with metadata
  - Query capability with filters
  - Vector ID management for updates

- **Landmark Processing**
  - Batch processing for all NYC landmarks
  - Incremental processing (only new/updated landmarks)
  - Progress tracking and reporting
  - Error handling with detailed logging
  - Robust attribute access for both dictionary and object responses
  - Modular code structure with focused helper functions

- **Wikipedia Integration**
  - Article fetching based on landmark names
  - Content filtering and cleaning
  - Embedding generation for article chunks
  - Storage alongside PDF content

## Work In Progress

- **Query API Enhancement**
  - Semantic search across landmark content
  - Combined search with metadata filters
  - Relevance scoring for results
  - Response formatting for API consumers

- **Chat Interface**
  - Basic conversation management
  - Context tracking between messages
  - LLM integration for responses
  - Knowledge grounding in landmark data

## Known Issues

- Some landmarks have minimal PDF content
- Embedding quality varies based on text content
- Wikipedia content may not always match landmarks perfectly
- Test coverage for edge cases needs expansion

## Recent Completions

- Fixed attribute access errors in landmark processing
  - Implemented `safe_get_attribute()` function to handle both dictionary and object access patterns
  - Successfully processed previously problematic landmarks (LP-00048, LP-00112, LP-00012)
  - Added improved logging for debugging and monitoring
  - Fixed type checking issues to ensure code reliability

- Improved code maintainability through refactoring
  - Reduced complexity in key functions by breaking them down into smaller units
  - Created specialized helper functions for common operations
  - Made code more testable and easier to reason about
  - Enhanced readability with focused functions that have clear responsibilities

- Added Wikipedia integration
  - Implemented article fetching and processing
  - Created embeddings for article content
  - Connected to landmark metadata for combined search

- Improved error handling and logging
  - Added detailed error messages for failed landmarks
  - Implemented structured logging for pipeline stages
  - Created result summaries for batch processing
