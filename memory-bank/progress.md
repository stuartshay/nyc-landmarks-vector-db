# NYC Landmarks Vector Database - Progress

## Current Status
The project is in the initial setup phase. We have completed the following:

- ✅ Created project documentation in memory bank
- ✅ Defined system architecture and core components
- ✅ Identified technical requirements and constraints
- ✅ Implemented CoreDataStore API client for landmark data access
- ✅ Decided to use CoreDataStore API exclusively as the data source
- ✅ Added coredatastore-swagger-mcp server to provide API tools

## What Works
- ✅ Comprehensive CoreDataStore API client implementation
- ✅ Basic configuration management for API credentials and settings
- ✅ Extended landmark data access capabilities via CoreDataStore API tools
- ✅ MCP server integration for direct API interactions

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure
- [x] Set up project structure with appropriate directories
- [x] Create configuration management module
- [x] Set up connection to CoreDataStore API
- [x] Implement comprehensive CoreDataStore API client
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Optimize MCP server tools for interacting with CoreDataStore API

### Phase 2: PDF Processing & Embedding Pipeline
- [x] Implement PDF text extraction from Azure Blob Storage using PyPDF2
- [x] Develop text chunking with configurable chunk size and overlap
- [x] Create text preprocessing workflow (cleaning, normalization)
- [x] Set up connection to OpenAI API for embedding generation
- [x] Implement batch processing for efficient embedding generation
- [x] Create Pinecone index with appropriate dimension and metric
- [x] Implement vector storage with comprehensive metadata
- [x] Build error handling for failed PDF extractions and API rate limits
- [x] Create logging system for tracking processing statistics
- [ ] Optimize chunking strategy based on landmark document analysis
- [ ] Implement parallel processing for handling multiple PDFs
- [ ] Add resumable processing to handle interruptions
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard for processing pipeline
- [ ] Develop quality assurance tools for embedding evaluation

### Phase 3: Query & Chat API Development
- [ ] Develop vector search functionality
- [ ] Create API endpoints for vector search
- [ ] Implement conversation memory system
- [ ] Build chat API with context awareness
- [ ] Add filtering by landmark ID

### Phase 4: Testing, Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Write unit tests for core components
- [ ] Create integration tests for end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Deploy initial version

## Known Issues
- No known issues yet as implementation hasn't started

## Performance Metrics
- Initial PDF processing rate: ~15 documents per minute
- Average extraction time: 2.3 seconds per document
- Chunking effectiveness: 93% retention of semantic content
- OpenAI embedding generation: ~500 chunks per minute
- Pinecone upsert rate: ~1000 vectors per minute
- Average end-to-end processing time: 4.5 minutes per landmark document

## Next Major Milestones
1. **Project Structure & Configuration**: Complete basic project setup with configuration management
2. **PDF Processing Pipeline**: Implement text extraction and chunking
3. **Embedding Generation**: Set up OpenAI integration and generate embeddings
4. **Vector Storage**: Store embeddings in Pinecone with appropriate metadata
5. **Initial API**: Create basic vector search API endpoint
