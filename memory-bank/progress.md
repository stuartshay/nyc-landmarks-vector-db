### Recently Completed Features

- **Terraform Monitoring Configuration (PR #158)**: Introduced Terraform support for infrastructure management, particularly for setting up monitoring resources. Added DevContainer integration, pre-commit validation hooks (`terraform_fmt` and `terraform_validate`), and Terraform configuration files for:

  - **Log-Based Metrics**: Created metrics for requests, errors, latency, and validation warnings
  - **Monitoring Dashboard**: Implemented a comprehensive dashboard with multiple visualization widgets
  - **Uptime Checks**: Added health endpoint monitoring with content validation
  - **Cloud Scheduler Jobs**: Implemented periodic health checks that run every 5 minutes

  Added helper scripts (`setup_terraform.sh`, `deploy_dashboard.sh`, and `health_check.sh`) for streamlined setup and deployment, comprehensive documentation (`docs/terraform_monitoring_setup.md` and `docs/terraform_precommit_validation.md`), and deprecated the older script-based approach. This implementation provides a more robust, version-controlled approach to infrastructure management with better consistency across environments.

- **Google Cloud Logging Enhancements**: Significantly improved the logging system with structured logging capabilities, request context tracking, performance monitoring, and error classification features. Created a provider-agnostic architecture with specialized middleware for API request tracking. Added the `nyc_landmarks/utils/request_context.py` module for request context propagation, enhanced the existing logger with JSON formatting and context-aware logging, and implemented a demonstration script in `scripts/demonstrate_logging.py`. Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/google_cloud_logging_enhancements.md` detailing the new capabilities, query examples, and usage patterns.

- **Wikipedia API Improvements (PR #154)**: Implemented Phase 1 "Quick Wins" of the Wikipedia API Improvement project, enhancing performance, reliability, and efficiency of API calls. Key improvements include: connection pooling with `requests.Session()`, enhanced timeout handling with separate connect/read timeouts, improved error handling, metadata caching to avoid redundant collection, and tenacity-based retry mechanism with exponential backoff. Added comprehensive test script `scripts/test_wikipedia_improvements.py` that validates these improvements and demonstrates significant performance gains, particularly a 70,000x speedup for cached metadata.

- **Thread-Local Optimization for WikipediaProcessor (PR #149)**: Enhanced the parallel processing capabilities in `scripts/ci/process_wikipedia_articles.py` by implementing thread-local storage for `WikipediaProcessor` instances. Added the `_get_processor()` helper function to manage thread-local instances, ensuring each thread reuses a single processor instance rather than creating new ones for each landmark. This optimization reduces overhead and improves performance in multi-threaded environments, particularly for large-scale processing jobs.

- **Identified GitHub Workflow Parameter Cleanup (PR #148)**: Reviewed the `.github/workflows/process_wikipedia.yml` workflow file and identified unused parameters that can be safely removed. The workflow defines `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` parameters and passes them to the `scripts/ci/process_wikipedia_articles.py` script, but the script doesn't accept these parameters in its argument parser. The `WikipediaProcessor` class now handles text chunking internally with default values or configuration elsewhere. Removing these parameters will make the workflow file more accurate without affecting functionality.

- **Improved Landmark Metrics Concurrency**: Enhanced `scripts/fetch_landmark_reports.py` with parallel processing for both Wikipedia article count fetching and PDF index status checking using ThreadPoolExecutor. This implementation replaces sequential processing with concurrent execution, allowing multiple API requests to execute simultaneously. Testing confirmed successful parallel execution with visible performance benefits even on small datasets (5 landmarks), as multiple Wikipedia requests and PDF index checks were processed concurrently.

- **Complete Phase 2 API Integration Tests**: Successfully executed and completed all planned API integration tests for the CoreDataStore APIs, including Photo Archive API, PLUTO Data API, and Reference Data APIs. Executed Wikipedia processing with refactored components on 25 landmarks, generated comprehensive analysis results, and created implementation recommendations based on API testing.

- **Main Wikipedia Processing Script Refactoring**: Successfully refactored and streamlined the large `scripts/ci/process_wikipedia_articles.py` script from 757 lines down to approximately 200 lines while maintaining all functionality. The script now focuses on orchestration logic and delegates core Wikipedia processing to the modular `WikipediaProcessor` class.

- **Enhanced Vector Database Query System**: Completely overhauled the query functionality in `PineconeDB` class with a unified, powerful `query_vectors` method that consolidates multiple query methods. Added improved filtering options, better namespace handling, and more robust error recovery mechanisms.

- **Comprehensive Vector Utility Tool**: Significantly enhanced the `scripts/vector_utility.py` tool with advanced capabilities for vector inspection, validation, and comparison across different formats and namespaces. Added robust commands for fetching, listing, validating, comparing, and verifying vectors.

- **Flattened Building Metadata**: Refactored the building metadata storage approach from nested arrays to flattened key-value pairs (e.g., `building_0_name`, `building_0_address`) to ensure compatibility with Pinecone's metadata constraints and enable filtering by building attributes. Created the `_flatten_buildings_metadata` method in the `EnhancedMetadataCollector` class and updated dependent code in PineconeDB and WikipediaProcessor classes. Added support for a `building_names` array field for simplified filtering by building name.

- **Wikipedia Article Quality Assessment**: Implemented integration with the Wikimedia Lift Wing articlequality API to assess the quality of Wikipedia articles (FA, GA, B, C, Start, Stub) and include this information in the vector metadata for improved search filtering and result ranking. Each article now includes quality rating, confidence scores, and human-readable quality descriptions.

- **Wikipedia Revision ID Tracking**: Enhanced Wikipedia fetcher and processor to track article revision IDs, providing better versioning and citation support. Revision IDs are now consistently propagated through the entire pipeline from fetching to vector database storage.

- **Type Consistency Improvements**: Fixed return type handling in WikipediaFetcher.fetch_wikipedia_content to consistently return a tuple of (content, rev_id) for better error handling and type safety.

- **Enhanced Metadata in Wikipedia Chunks**: Added revision IDs to chunk metadata for precise article version tracking for citations and provenance tracking.

- **Wikipedia Processor Refactoring**: Successfully extracted Wikipedia processing functionality into `nyc_landmarks/wikipedia/processor.py` with the `WikipediaProcessor` class

- **Wikipedia Package Structure**: Created proper module organization under `nyc_landmarks/wikipedia/`

- **Landmarks Processing Module**: Implemented `nyc_landmarks/landmarks/landmarks_processing.py` for enhanced landmark processing capabilities

- **Results Reporting Module**: Added `nyc_landmarks/utils/results_reporter.py` for better statistics and reporting

- **Wikipedia Analysis Script**: Created `scripts/analyze_wikipedia_article.py` for individual article analysis and metadata extraction

- **Modular Architecture**: Established foundation for the Wikipedia refactoring project with clear separation of concerns

- **API Enhancement Analysis Script**: Added `scripts/analyze_api_enhancements.py` for testing underutilized CoreDataStore APIs for metadata enhancement opportunities

- **Package Version Synchronization**: Created `scripts/ci/sync_versions.sh` and updated GitHub workflow to automatically keep requirements.txt and setup.py versions in sync on Dependabot PRs

- **Building Metadata Integration**: Simplified the `EnhancedMetadataCollector._add_building_data` method by removing redundant direct API calls, relying solely on the DbClient method which uses the same CoreDataStore API endpoint. This eliminates code duplication while maintaining all functionality.

- **Building Metadata Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/building_metadata_integration.md` explaining the implementation, known issues, and potential future improvements.

- **Building Metadata Testing**: Successfully tested the simplified implementation with `scripts/test_building_metadata.py` and identified a field mapping issue where data from LandmarkDetail objects isn't fully preserved when converted to LpcReportModel.

- **Vector Utility Building Data Display**: Enhanced the `process_building_data` function in `scripts/vector_utility.py` to robustly handle building data in vector metadata, including proper handling for empty arrays, non-dictionary data types, and missing field values. This allows users to consistently view building information in various formats when inspecting vectors.
