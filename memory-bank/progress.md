# Progress - NYC Landmarks Vector Database

## What Works

- **PDF Processing Pipeline**: Completed and fully functional; processes landmark PDFs into chunks for vector storage
- **Landmark Status Tracking**: We can track the processing status of each landmark PDF document
- **Enhanced Vector Metadata**: Our vectors contain enriched metadata for more precise searching
- **Pinecone Vector DB Integration**: Successfully storing and querying vectors with proper namespacing
- **API Foundation**: Basic API structure is in place with endpoints for both querying and chat functionality
- **Vector ID Standardization**: Implemented consistent ID formats for both PDF and Wikipedia content
  - PDF vectors: `{landmark_id}-chunk-{chunk_num}`
  - Wikipedia vectors: `wiki-{article_title}-{landmark_id}-chunk-{chunk_num}`
- **Wikipedia Article Integration**: Extension to incorporate Wikipedia content related to landmarks

## Recently Completed

1. **Vector ID Standardization**: Created a comprehensive script `scripts/regenerate_pinecone_index.py` that:
   - Backs up all vectors by source type (PDF, Wikipedia, or test)
   - Standardizes vector IDs using deterministic format rules
   - Reimports vectors with standardized IDs
   - Includes verification and reporting capabilities

2. **Vector Verification Utilities**: Added tools to detect and report on inconsistent ID formats

3. **Landmark Processing Status Checks**: Enhanced with vector ID verification capabilities

4. **Memory Bank Documentation**: Updated to reflect vector ID standardization approach and progress

## In Progress

- **Test Updates**: Updating integration tests to expect standardized ID formats
- **Wikipedia Article Processing**: Completing the GitHub Actions workflow integration
- **Combined Source Search**: Enhancing search capabilities to leverage both PDF and Wikipedia content
- **Chat API Enhancement**: Updating to utilize combined sources with proper attribution

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Vector ID Standardization**: Run the regenerate script to apply standardized IDs
2. **Update Tests**: Ensure all tests work with standardized ID formats
3. **Complete Wikipedia Integration**: Finish CI/CD pipeline changes for Wikipedia processing
4. **Vector Search Improvements**: Fine-tune search algorithms to use both content sources
5. **User Interface Extensions**: Add source attribution to chat interface

## Known Issues

- Some older vectors have inconsistent ID formats (being addressed with the standardization script)
- Integration tests need updates to account for the standardized vector ID formats
- Need to synchronize vector ID formats between production and test environments
