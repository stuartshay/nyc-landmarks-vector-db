# NYC Landmarks Vector Database - Progress

## Current Status
The project is in the initial setup phase. We have completed the following:

- âœ… Created project documentation in memory bank
- âœ… Defined system architecture and core components
- âœ… Identified technical requirements and constraints

## What Works
- ðŸš« No implemented functionality yet

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up project structure with appropriate directories
- [ ] Create configuration management module
- [ ] Set up connections to external services
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging

### Phase 2: PDF Processing & Embedding Pipeline
- [ ] Implement PDF text extraction from Azure Blob Storage
- [ ] Develop text chunking and preprocessing functionality
- [ ] Set up connection to OpenAI API for embedding generation
- [ ] Create Pinecone index and implement vector storage
- [ ] Build batch processing system for embedding generation

### Phase 3: Query & Chat API Development
- [ ] Develop vector search functionality
- [ ] Create API endpoints for vector search
- [ ] Implement conversation memory system
- [ ] Build chat API with context awareness
- [ ] Add filtering by landmark ID

### Phase 4: Testing, Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Write unit tests for core components
- [ ] Create integration tests for end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Deploy initial version

## Known Issues
- No known issues yet as implementation hasn't started

## Performance Metrics
- No metrics yet as implementation hasn't started

## Next Major Milestones
