# Progress

## What Works

- **Data Pipeline**: The landmark processing pipeline is operational, processing PDF reports and extracting metadata.
- **API Endpoints**: Basic API endpoints are implemented and functional.
- **Vector Database Integration**: PineconeDB integration is working, with proper vector storage and retrieval.
- **Google Cloud Logging**: Enhanced logging system with structured JSON logging, request context tracking, and performance monitoring.
- **Wikipedia Integration**: Refactored and enhanced Wikipedia integration with improved API interactions, connection pooling, and error handling.
- **Building Metadata**: Building data is properly extracted, flattened, and stored in the vector database.
- **Vector Database Queries**: Enhanced query capabilities with improved filtering options, namespace handling, and error recovery.
- **Monitoring Setup**: Basic monitoring dashboard setup with metrics for API requests, errors, and latency.
- **Local Development Environment**: DevContainer environment setup with proper VS Code settings and extensions.
- **VectorDB Logging Metric and View**: Successfully added vector database logging metric and dedicated log bucket with view.

## What's Left

- **Improved Error Handling**: Further enhance error handling throughout the application.
- **Enhanced Vector Database Monitoring**: Add more specific metrics for different vector database operations and improve dashboard visualization.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement async content fetching for Wikipedia articles and optimize memory usage.
- **Cache Implementation**: Add comprehensive caching for Wikipedia content and quality assessments.
- **Metadata Enhancement**: Implement improved metadata extraction patterns and schema.
- **Testing Coverage**: Increase test coverage across the application.
- **Documentation**: Improve documentation for API endpoints, vector operations, and setup procedures.
- **Alerting Policies**: Implement comprehensive alerting for service health and performance issues.

## Current Status

As of our latest updates, we have:

- Fixed PR #194 to properly integrate vector database monitoring in the Terraform configuration:

  - Updated dashboard template to include widgets for vector database metrics
  - Added specific metrics for vector database errors and slow operations
  - Created alert policies for vector database error rate, inactivity, and slow operations
  - Updated documentation with detailed information on vector database monitoring

- Completed implementation of PR #158 - Terraform Monitoring Configuration:

  - Added comprehensive monitoring dashboard for API metrics
  - Implemented log-based metrics for requests, errors, latency, and validation warnings
  - Set up uptime checks and health monitoring
  - Created Cloud Scheduler job for periodic health checks

- Enhanced Google Cloud Logging implementation:

  - Implemented structured JSON logging
  - Added request context tracking
  - Created performance monitoring capabilities
  - Added standardized error classification

- Implemented Phase 1 of Wikipedia API Improvements (PR #154):

  - Added connection pooling with `requests.Session()`
  - Enhanced timeout handling
  - Improved error handling
  - Implemented metadata caching
  - Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff

- Implemented Thread-Local Optimization for WikipediaProcessor (PR #149):

  - Enhanced parallel processing capabilities
  - Improved performance in multi-threaded environments

- Successfully refactored the Wikipedia processing script (PR #143):

  - Extracted core functionality to modular components
  - Improved maintainability and testability
  - Enhanced error handling and reporting

## Known Issues

- Building metadata field mapping has some inconsistencies that need to be resolved.
- Wikipedia API occasionally has timeout issues for large articles.
- Memory usage during large batch processing could be optimized.
- Dashboard would benefit from additional vector database specific metrics and visualizations.
- Alert notification channels need to be configured in production environment.

## Next Steps

1. Continue with Phase 2 of the Wikipedia API Improvement project, focusing on async content fetching and enhanced caching.
1. Implement more granular metrics for vector database operations to improve monitoring.
1. Deploy the updated Terraform monitoring configuration to production.
1. Implement the remaining alert policies for comprehensive system monitoring.
1. Extend test coverage to include the new monitoring and alerting components.
