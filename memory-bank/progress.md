# Progress - NYC Landmarks Vector Database

## What Works

- **PDF Processing Pipeline**: Completed and fully functional; processes landmark PDFs into chunks for vector storage
- **Landmark Status Tracking**: We can track the processing status of each landmark PDF document
- **Enhanced Vector Metadata**: Our vectors contain enriched metadata for more precise searching
- **Pinecone Vector DB Integration**: Successfully storing and querying vectors with proper namespacing
- **API Foundation**: Basic API structure is in place with endpoints for both querying and chat functionality
- **Vector ID Standardization**: Implemented consistent ID formats for both PDF and Wikipedia content
  - PDF vectors: `{landmark_id}-chunk-{chunk_num}`
  - Wikipedia vectors: `wiki-{article_title}-{landmark_id}-chunk-{chunk_num}`
- **Wikipedia Article Integration**: Extension to incorporate Wikipedia content related to landmarks

## Recently Completed

1. **Vector ID Standardization**: Created a comprehensive script `scripts/regenerate_pinecone_index.py` that:
   - Backs up all vectors by source type (PDF, Wikipedia, or test)
   - Standardizes vector IDs using deterministic format rules
   - Reimports vectors with standardized IDs
   - Includes verification and reporting capabilities

2. **Vector Verification Utilities**: Added tools to detect and report on inconsistent ID formats

3. **Landmark Processing Status Checks**: Enhanced with vector ID verification capabilities

4. **Memory Bank Documentation**: Updated to reflect vector ID standardization approach and progress

5. **API Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation in `memory-bank/api_documentation.md` including:
   - Complete Mermaid diagram of the process_landmarks GitHub Action workflow
   - Detailed documentation of the CoreDataStore API schema and endpoints with corrected response schemas
   - Data flow and transformation documentation
   - GitHub Action configuration options

## Recently Validated

1. **Pinecone Vector Validation Testing**:
   - Ran `tests/integration/test_pinecone_validation.py` to verify vector consistency
   - Confirmed the index has 16,146 vectors in total
   - Found inconsistent ID formats for landmark LP-00001 (`test-LP-00001-LP-00001-chunk-X` instead of the standard format)
   - Verified that 3 out of 4 tested landmarks have correct vector ID formats
   - Confirmed that all landmarks have consistent metadata despite ID format issues

## In Progress

- **Test Updates**: Updating integration tests to expect standardized ID formats
- **Wikipedia Article Processing**: Completing the GitHub Actions workflow integration
- **Combined Source Search**: Enhancing search capabilities to leverage both PDF and Wikipedia content
- **Chat API Enhancement**: Updating to utilize combined sources with proper attribution

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Vector ID Standardization**:
   - Run the `scripts/regenerate_pinecone_index.py` script with the `--verbose` flag to standardize all vector IDs
   - Focus on fixing LP-00001 vectors that use the incorrect `test-LP-00001-LP-00001-chunk-X` format
   - Verify results using the validation testing suite

2. **Testing Infrastructure Updates**:
   - Update `tests/integration/test_pinecone_validation.py` to remove special handling for LP-00001's non-standard format
   - Adjust all tests to expect standardized ID formats consistently
   - Run the full test suite to ensure compatibility with the standardized vectors

3. **Complete Wikipedia Integration**:
   - Implement Wikipedia processing in the GitHub Actions workflow
   - Add verification steps to the CI/CD pipeline
   - Create dedicated integration tests for the Wikipedia pipeline

4. **Query API Enhancement**:
   - Extend the Query API to leverage both Wikipedia and PDF content
   - Add source attribution in search results
   - Use `landmark_query_testing.ipynb` to verify enhanced search functionality

5. **Chat API Extensions**:
   - Update to leverage content from both Wikipedia and PDF sources
   - Implement proper source attribution in responses
   - Add comprehensive testing with multiple content sources

## Known Issues

- Some older vectors have inconsistent ID formats (LP-00001 vectors use `test-LP-00001-LP-00001-chunk-X` format)
- Integration tests fail when expecting the standardized vector ID format for LP-00001
- Need to synchronize vector ID formats between production and test environments
