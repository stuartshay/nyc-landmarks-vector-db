# NYC Landmarks Vector Database - Progress

## What Works

- Core landmarks data fetching from CoreDataStore API

- PDF text extraction from landmark reports

- Text chunking for optimal embedding

- Embedding generation using OpenAI's text-embedding models

- Pinecone vector database storage and retrieval

- Query API with filtering capabilities

- Chat API with conversation memory

- End-to-end pipeline from data extraction to vector storage

- Support for filtering by landmark ID

- Integration with CoreDataStore API as the data source

  - Storage in vector database

- **Test Coverage**

  - Unit tests for db_client module with 96% code coverage (improved from 76%)
  - Well-organized test suite with functional grouping across three files:
    - `test_db_client.py`: Core functionality tests
    - `test_db_client_additional.py`: Additional functionality tests
    - `test_db_client_coverage.py`: Coverage-focused tests
  - Comprehensive test documentation in tests/unit/README.md
  - Clear separation of concerns in test cases
  - Edge case handling and error condition testing
  - Detailed documentation in memory-bank/test-improvements.md

- **Vector Database Integration**

  - Pinecone index configuration and management
  - Vector storage with metadata
  - Query capability with filters
  - Vector ID management for updates

- **Landmark Processing**

  - Batch processing for all NYC landmarks
  - Incremental processing (only new/updated landmarks)
  - Progress tracking and reporting
  - Error handling with detailed logging
  - Robust attribute access for both dictionary and object responses
  - Modular code structure with focused helper functions
  - Pagination support for efficient batch processing
  - Full database processing with the `--all` option

- **Wikipedia Integration**

  - Article fetching based on landmark names
  - Content filtering and cleaning
  - Embedding generation for article chunks
  - Storage alongside PDF content
  - Page-based fetching for controlled batch processing
  - Complete database processing capabilities

## Work In Progress

- **Query API Enhancement**

  - Semantic search across landmark content
  - Combined search with metadata filters
  - Relevance scoring for results
  - Response formatting for API consumers

- **Chat Interface**

  - Basic conversation management
  - Context tracking between messages
  - LLM integration for responses
  - Knowledge grounding in landmark data

## Known Issues

- Some landmarks have minimal PDF content
- Embedding quality varies based on text content
- Wikipedia content may not always match landmarks perfectly
- Test coverage for edge cases needs expansion
- Large Wikipedia articles can exceed token limits for embedding models
  - Observed with The Ansonia (LP-00285) causing a 400 error due to the article's 11,091 tokens exceeding the model's 8,192 token limit
- Many landmarks don't have associated Wikipedia articles
  - Approximately 60% of landmarks tested on page 3 had no Wikipedia content
- Processing across multiple pages requires careful handling of limits to ensure a balanced workload

## Recent Completions

  - Set up foundation for extending coverage to other modules

- **Fixed Wikipedia Article Processing in CoreDataStoreAPI**

  - Updated `get_wikipedia_articles` method to use the correct `/api/WebContent/batch` endpoint
  - Implemented proper case-insensitive handling for landmark IDs in API responses
  - Added robust type checking and validation for API response data
  - Implemented detailed logging for troubleshooting API responses
  - Fixed the filter logic for Wikipedia article records

  - Validated all key parameter combinations:
    - `--all --page-size 50 --verbose`: Process all landmarks with page size 50
    - `--all --page-size 50 --limit 5 --verbose`: Process first 5 landmarks with page size 50
    - `--page 2 --page-size 50 --verbose`: Start from page 2 with page size 50
    - `--page 2 --limit 5 --page-size 50 --verbose`: Process 5 landmarks from page 2 with page size 50
  - Improved documentation in help text to indicate incompatible arguments
  - Tested with different page sizes to optimize API requests and processing
