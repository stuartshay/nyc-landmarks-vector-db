# Project Progress

## What Works

### Core System Components

- Core landmark vector database is operational
- API endpoints for querying landmarks are functional
- PDF processing pipeline for extracting landmark information works reliably
- Wikipedia integration for extracting additional landmark information is functional
- Basic vector search capabilities are implemented and tested

### Recently Completed Features

- Created custom Wikipedia article analysis script that successfully extracts potential metadata fields
- Implemented pattern-based extraction to identify attributes like year built, architect, architectural style
- Developed JSON and plain text dump functionality for analyzing Wikipedia content
- Created comprehensive metadata analysis report with recommendations for enhancements
- Successfully tested Wikipedia content extraction on sample landmarks

## In Progress

### Wikipedia Metadata Enhancement

- Improving extraction patterns for better context understanding
- Refining architectural style extraction to reduce false positives
- Expanding extraction capabilities to capture additional metadata fields

### Vector Database Improvements

- Preparing schema updates to accommodate new metadata fields from Wikipedia
- Developing validation strategies for the new metadata fields

## What's Left to Build

### Wikipedia Processing Pipeline Enhancements

- Implement entity recognition for more accurate metadata extraction
- Create standardized vocabularies for architectural styles, building materials, etc.
- Develop improved context-aware extraction patterns
- Implement validation mechanisms for extracted metadata

### Database Schema Updates

- Update metadata models to include new Wikipedia-derived fields
- Modify vector database schema to incorporate new metadata
- Update metadata validators for the new fields

### Search Enhancements

- Update query API to support filtering by new metadata fields
- Add capability to search landmarks by architectural style, historical figures, etc.
- Implement faceted search capabilities using the enhanced metadata

### Documentation and Testing

- Update API documentation to reflect new metadata fields
- Create test cases for new metadata extraction
- Implement integration tests for the enhanced pipeline

## Known Issues

- Regex-based extraction produces false positives for certain metadata fields
- Architectural style extraction needs refinement to extract clean style names
- Year extraction sometimes picks up years from later renovations instead of construction
- Wikipedia URL handling needs improvement for article sections (#section references)
