## What Works

### Core System Components

- Core landmark vector database is operational
- API endpoints for querying landmarks are functional
- PDF processing pipeline for extracting landmark information works reliably
- Wikipedia integration for extracting additional landmark information is functional
- Wikipedia article quality assessment for enhanced metadata and filtering
- Basic vector search capabilities are implemented and tested

### Recently Completed Features

- **Complete Phase 2 API Integration Tests**: Successfully executed and completed all planned API integration tests for the CoreDataStore APIs, including Photo Archive API, PLUTO Data API, and Reference Data APIs. Executed Wikipedia processing with refactored components on 25 landmarks, generated comprehensive analysis results, and created implementation recommendations based on API testing.
- **Main Wikipedia Processing Script Refactoring**: Successfully refactored and streamlined the large `scripts/ci/process_wikipedia_articles.py` script from 757 lines down to approximately 200 lines while maintaining all functionality. The script now focuses on orchestration logic and delegates core Wikipedia processing to the modular `WikipediaProcessor` class.
- **Enhanced Vector Database Query System**: Completely overhauled the query functionality in `PineconeDB` class with a unified, powerful `query_vectors` method that consolidates multiple query methods. Added improved filtering options, better namespace handling, and more robust error recovery mechanisms.
- **Comprehensive Vector Utility Tool**: Significantly enhanced the `scripts/vector_utility.py` tool with advanced capabilities for vector inspection, validation, and comparison across different formats and namespaces. Added robust commands for fetching, listing, validating, comparing, and verifying vectors.
- **Flattened Building Metadata**: Refactored the building metadata storage approach from nested arrays to flattened key-value pairs (e.g., `building_0_name`, `building_0_address`) to ensure compatibility with Pinecone's metadata constraints and enable filtering by building attributes. Created the `_flatten_buildings_metadata` method in the `EnhancedMetadataCollector` class and updated dependent code in PineconeDB and WikipediaProcessor classes. Added support for a `building_names` array field for simplified filtering by building name.
- **Wikipedia Article Quality Assessment**: Implemented integration with the Wikimedia Lift Wing articlequality API to assess the quality of Wikipedia articles (FA, GA, B, C, Start, Stub) and include this information in the vector metadata for improved search filtering and result ranking. Each article now includes quality rating, confidence scores, and human-readable quality descriptions.
- **Wikipedia Revision ID Tracking**: Enhanced Wikipedia fetcher and processor to track article revision IDs, providing better versioning and citation support. Revision IDs are now consistently propagated through the entire pipeline from fetching to vector database storage.
- **Type Consistency Improvements**: Fixed return type handling in WikipediaFetcher.fetch_wikipedia_content to consistently return a tuple of (content, rev_id) for better error handling and type safety.
- **Enhanced Metadata in Wikipedia Chunks**: Added revision IDs to chunk metadata for precise article version tracking for citations and provenance tracking.
- **Wikipedia Processor Refactoring**: Successfully extracted Wikipedia processing functionality into `nyc_landmarks/wikipedia/processor.py` with the `WikipediaProcessor` class
- **Wikipedia Package Structure**: Created proper module organization under `nyc_landmarks/wikipedia/`
- **Landmarks Processing Module**: Implemented `nyc_landmarks/landmarks/landmarks_processing.py` for enhanced landmark processing capabilities
- **Results Reporting Module**: Added `nyc_landmarks/utils/results_reporter.py` for better statistics and reporting
- **Wikipedia Analysis Script**: Created `scripts/analyze_wikipedia_article.py` for individual article analysis and metadata extraction
- **Modular Architecture**: Established foundation for the Wikipedia refactoring project with clear separation of concerns
- **API Enhancement Analysis Script**: Added `scripts/analyze_api_enhancements.py` for testing underutilized CoreDataStore APIs for metadata enhancement opportunities
- **Package Version Synchronization**: Created `scripts/ci/sync_versions.sh` and updated GitHub workflow to automatically keep requirements.txt and setup.py versions in sync on Dependabot PRs
- **Building Metadata Integration**: Simplified the `EnhancedMetadataCollector._add_building_data` method by removing redundant direct API calls, relying solely on the DbClient method which uses the same CoreDataStore API endpoint. This eliminates code duplication while maintaining all functionality.
- **Building Metadata Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/building_metadata_integration.md` explaining the implementation, known issues, and potential future improvements.
- **Building Metadata Testing**: Successfully tested the simplified implementation with `scripts/test_building_metadata.py` and identified a field mapping issue where data from LandmarkDetail objects isn't fully preserved when converted to LpcReportModel.
- **Vector Utility Building Data Display**: Enhanced the `process_building_data` function in `scripts/vector_utility.py` to robustly handle building data in vector metadata, including proper handling for empty arrays, non-dictionary data types, and missing field values. This allows users to consistently view building information in various formats when inspecting vectors.

## In Progress

- Testing refactored components to ensure functionality preservation
- Validating performance parity with original implementation

## What's Left to Build

### Wikipedia API Improvement Project

- Implement connection pooling with `requests.Session()` in Wikipedia fetcher
- Add persistent session management for HTTP requests
- Configure proper keep-alive settings for better connection reuse
- Enhance timeout handling with separate connect vs. read timeouts
- Implement metadata caching per landmark to avoid redundant collection
- Enhance error handling and logging with more detailed information

#### Phase 2 - Performance Optimization

## Known Issues

- **Wikipedia API Inefficiencies**: Current implementation has inefficient HTTP request handling, lacks proper connection pooling, and uses simplistic rate limiting
- **Lack of Caching**: No caching mechanism exists for Wikipedia content or API responses, leading to redundant fetching of the same content
- **Limited Error Handling**: Current retry logic is basic and lacks sophisticated error recovery mechanisms
- **Content Extraction Robustness**: BeautifulSoup parsing could be more robust with fallback mechanisms for different page structures
- **Original Script Dependencies**: Main script still needs to be updated to use refactored components
- **Metadata Extraction Accuracy**: Wikipedia regex-based extraction needs refinement for better precision
- **Performance Impact**: Need to measure and optimize performance impact of API integrations
- **Testing Coverage**: Refactored components need comprehensive test coverage before production use
- **API Error Handling**: Some CoreDataStore API endpoints return 404 for valid landmarks that simply don't have the requested data, requiring careful error handling to distinguish between actual errors and expected "no data" responses
