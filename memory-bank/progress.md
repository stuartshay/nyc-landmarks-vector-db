# Project Progress

## What Works

### Core Features

- Vector database integration (Pinecone)
- PDF processing pipeline for landmarks
- API for landmark queries
- Chat API for conversational interaction
- Wikipedia integration for landmark data enrichment
- Jupyter notebook interfaces for data exploration

### User Interface

- Jupyter notebook widget-based interfaces for data exploration
- Pagination controls for exploring large datasets
- Query interfaces for vector database testing

### Testing & Validation

- Unit and integration test suites
- Vector database validation tools
- Metadata consistency checking

## Recent Improvements

### 2025-05-23: Notebook UI Enhancement

- Fixed pagination layout in `wikipedia_integration_testing.ipynb`
- Improved usability by placing pager on top and reorganizing controls
- Created a reusable pattern for widget organization that can be applied to other notebooks
- Developed a script to automate notebook cell modifications for standardization

### Previous Updates

- Standardized vector ID format across the system
- Improved error handling in database client
- Enhanced type checking for better code reliability
- Created comprehensive test suite for database operations
- Added Wikipedia article integration to enrich landmark data

## What's Left to Build

### Short-term Tasks

- Standardize pagination widget layout across all notebooks
- Create helper functions for common widget patterns
- Test notebooks in various environments to ensure consistent rendering
- Review and update notebook documentation standards

### Medium-term Tasks

- Improve performance of vector querying for large datasets
- Enhance Wikipedia content processing for better semantic search
- Develop more sophisticated vector filtering options
- Create advanced visualization tools for data exploration

### Long-term Goals

- Develop a web-based frontend for easier access to the data
- Implement user authentication and permission system
- Create automated data refresh pipelines
- Build a comprehensive dashboard for system monitoring

## Known Issues

- Some Jupyter notebook compatibility issues with VS Code
- Potential performance bottlenecks with large datasets
- Wikipedia article coverage is incomplete for some landmarks
- Test suite occasionally encounters timeout issues with API calls
