# Project Progress

## Completed

- ✅ Set up basic infrastructure (repository, framework)
- ✅ Core modules implementation
- ✅ PDF extraction from Azure Blob Storage
- ✅ Initial text chunking for embedding
- ✅ OpenAI embedding generation
- ✅ Basic Pinecone storage implementation
- ✅ API endpoint specification
- ✅ Vector search implementation
- ✅ Wikipedia article fetching and integration
- ✅ Combined search across PDF and Wikipedia content
- ✅ Initial GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ API endpoint for chat
- ✅ Conversation memory for chatbot
- ✅ Testing framework for core components
- ✅ Basic documentation
- ✅ Null metadata handling fix
- ✅ Fixed landmark processing script to handle LpcReportDetailResponse objects correctly
  - Successfully processed problematic landmarks (LP-00048, LP-00112, LP-00012)
  - Added support for processing specific landmark IDs via command line arguments
- ✅ Enhanced debug logging in vector verification script

## In Progress

- 🚧 Fixing issues with GitHub Actions and rebuilding Pinecone index
- 🚧 Enhanced error handling and robustness
- 🚧 Comprehensive test coverage
- 🚧 Addressing embedding storage/retrieval issues in Pinecone vectors
  - Current verification shows vector IDs and metadata valid, but embeddings (values) missing
  - Need to investigate why vectors are stored without embeddings or why they aren't retrieved

## Next Up

- 📅 Performance optimization for embedding generation and storage
- 📅 Enhanced attribution of sources in responses
- 📅 User feedback integration
- 📅 API usage metrics and monitoring
- 📅 Extended documentation
- 📅 Integration testing with frontend components

## Known Issues

1. ⚠️ Missing embeddings in Pinecone vectors (requiring index recreation or fixing storage method)
2. ⚠️ Some integration test failures in CI environment (working in local tests)
3. ⚠️ Vector verification shows proper vector IDs and metadata, but 0% valid embeddings

## Recent Achievements

- Successfully implemented fixes for null metadata handling and validated with integration tests
- Added comprehensive error handling for different response types from the CoreDataStore API
- Implemented and verified Wikipedia article integration into the vector database
- Fixed landmark processing script to properly handle Pydantic model responses
- Successfully processed previously problematic landmarks (LP-00048, LP-00112, LP-00012)
- Enhanced debugging in the vector verification script to better diagnose embedding issues
