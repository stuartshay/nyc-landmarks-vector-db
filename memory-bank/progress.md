## Current Status

### Terraform Cloud Implementation (PR #196)

Status: **In Progress**

Completed:

- ✅ Added Terraform Cloud configuration in versions.tf
- ✅ Successfully authenticated with Terraform Cloud
- ✅ Created .terraformignore file to exclude Python environments
- ✅ Updated workspace configuration to use correct directory path
- ✅ Fixed sensitive outputs in Terraform configuration
- ✅ Successfully ran Terraform plan through Terraform Cloud

Remaining:

- ⬜ Configure GCP credentials in Terraform Cloud workspace
- ⬜ Migrate terraform.tfvars variables to Terraform Cloud
- ⬜ Set up GitHub VCS integration with Terraform Cloud
- ⬜ Update deployment scripts for Terraform Cloud
- ⬜ Perform complete run cycle (plan and apply)
- ⬜ Document the full setup process

### API Performance Optimization

Status: **Planning**

Focus areas:

- Query execution time optimization
- Response size management
- Caching strategy implementation
- Connection pooling

## Known Issues

### Vector Database

1. **Issue**: Occasional timeout on vector searches with large result sets

   - **Impact**: User queries with broad scope may fail
   - **Workaround**: Implement pagination and limit result size
   - **Status**: Investigating Pinecone query optimization options

1. **Issue**: Duplicate vectors for some landmarks

   - **Impact**: Search results may contain duplicates
   - **Workaround**: Post-processing to remove duplicates
   - **Status**: Planning cleanup script

### API

1. **Issue**: Cold start latency on infrequent API usage

   - **Impact**: First request after idle period is slow
   - **Workaround**: Periodic warm-up requests via Cloud Scheduler
   - **Status**: Implemented, monitoring effectiveness

1. **Issue**: Rate limiting on Wikipedia API affects article retrieval

   - **Impact**: Batch processing of multiple landmarks can fail
   - **Workaround**: Implemented exponential backoff and retry
   - **Status**: Working, but needs optimization

### Infrastructure

1. **Issue**: Dashboard rendering performance with many metrics

   - **Impact**: Slow loading of monitoring dashboard
   - **Workaround**: Split into multiple focused dashboards
   - **Status**: Planned for next infrastructure update

1. **Issue**: Terraform Cloud workspace path configuration

   - **Impact**: Initial plan operations were failing
   - **Workaround**: Updated workspace settings via API
   - **Status**: Resolved
