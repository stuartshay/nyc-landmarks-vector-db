- ✅ Added integration tests to verify proper fixed ID functionality and backward compatibility
- ✅ Added metadata consistency verification to the test suite to ensure proper data integrity
- ✅ Vector database verification system with both standalone script and integrated test modules
- ✅ Implemented reusable verification components that can be used in both manual scripts and automated tests
- ✅ Created detailed validation for vector IDs and metadata consistency
- ✅ Updated to latest stable dependency versions for improved functionality and security
- ✅ Created comprehensive Pydantic models for Wikipedia article data (`WikipediaArticleModel`, `WikipediaContentModel`, `WikipediaProcessingResult`)
- ✅ Implemented CoreDataStore API client methods to fetch Wikipedia articles for landmarks
- ✅ Developed Wikipedia content fetcher with robust error handling, rate limiting, and retry mechanisms
- ✅ Implemented Wikipedia text processing pipeline (cleaning, chunking) optimized for article content
- ✅ Created processing script for Wikipedia article embedding and storage in Pinecone
- ✅ Added notebook for testing and analyzing Wikipedia content integration (`wikipedia_integration_testing.ipynb`)
- ✅ Fixed vector ID format to properly distinguish Wikipedia vectors (`wiki-Wyckoff_House-LP-00001-chunk-0`) from PDF vectors
- ✅ Created verification script for Wikipedia imports to validate integration
- ✅ Successfully stored and verified Wikipedia articles for test landmarks (LP-00001, LP-00003, and LP-00004)
- ✅ Implemented combined search functionality to query both Wikipedia and PDF sources with source filtering
- ✅ Created test script (`test_combined_search.py`) that demonstrates searching across both source types
- ✅ Centralized dependency management through `manage_packages.sh` script for synchronized versioning between requirements.txt and setup.py

## Known Issues
- Pylance errors in the Pydantic models due to import issues (can be resolved with proper environment setup)
- Integration tests depend on CoreDataStore API being available
- MCP server tests need to be run in an environment with the server connected
- Inconsistent vector ID formats detected in the Pinecone index, particularly for landmark LP-00001:
  - Expected format: `{landmark_id}-chunk-{chunk_num}`
  - Some vectors have legacy formats like `test-LP-00001-LP-00001-chunk-0`
  - This will require regenerating the index to standardize ID formats
- [RESOLVED] Previous CI/CD workflow failed due to missing Dockerfile. This has now been fixed.
- [RESOLVED] Fixed flake8 issues including unnecessary dict comprehension, unnecessary generators (set comprehensions), f-string with missing placeholders, and syntactic errors in coredatastore_api.py. The remaining complexity issues (C901) will require more extensive refactoring.
- [RESOLVED] Inconsistent script file permissions - added proper shebang lines and execute permissions
