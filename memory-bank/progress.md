# Progress - NYC Landmarks Vector Database

## What Works

- **PDF Processing Pipeline**: Completed and fully functional; processes landmark PDFs into chunks for vector storage
- **Landmark Status Tracking**: We can track the processing status of each landmark PDF document
- **Enhanced Vector Metadata**: Our vectors contain enriched metadata for more precise searching
- **Pinecone Vector DB Integration**: Successfully storing and querying vectors with proper namespacing
- **API Foundation**: Basic API structure is in place with endpoints for both querying and chat functionality
- **Vector ID Standardization**: Implemented consistent ID formats for both PDF and Wikipedia content
  - PDF vectors: `{landmark_id}-chunk-{chunk_num}`
  - Wikipedia vectors: `wiki-{article_title}-{landmark_id}-chunk-{chunk_num}`
- **Wikipedia Article Integration**: Extension to incorporate Wikipedia content related to landmarks
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Enhanced DbClient and related code with better type annotations and error handling

## Recently Completed

1. **Type Safety Improvements**:
   - Fixed DbClient implementation to properly handle type conversions between dict and Pydantic models
   - Created proper type stub for `db_client.py` to satisfy mypy type checking
   - Enhanced error handling for dict-to-model conversions with safe fallbacks
   - Improved landmark buildings retrieval to ensure consistent return types
   - Added robust error logging for conversion failures
   - Fixed mypy errors in the core DbClient functionality

2. **Vector ID Standardization**: Created a comprehensive script `scripts/regenerate_pinecone_index.py` that:
   - Backs up all vectors by source type (PDF, Wikipedia, or test)
   - Standardizes vector IDs using deterministic format rules
   - Reimports vectors with standardized IDs
   - Includes verification and reporting capabilities

3. **Vector Verification Utilities**: Added tools to detect and report on inconsistent ID formats

4. **Landmark Processing Status Checks**: Enhanced with vector ID verification capabilities

5. **Memory Bank Documentation**: Updated to reflect vector ID standardization approach and progress

6. **API Documentation and Schema Updates**: Created comprehensive documentation in `memory-bank/api_documentation.md` including:
   - Complete Mermaid diagram of the process_landmarks GitHub Action workflow
   - Detailed documentation of the CoreDataStore API schema and endpoints with corrected response schemas
   - Reference to the definitive Swagger JSON schema at `https://api.coredatastore.com/swagger/v1/swagger.json`
   - Data flow and transformation documentation
   - GitHub Action configuration options
   - Updated Pydantic models in `nyc_landmarks/models/landmark_models.py` to match actual API responses
   - Created new Pydantic models for detailed landmark endpoint (`LpcReportDetailResponse`, `MapData`, `MapPoint`, etc.)
   - Updated next steps to include ensuring all API interaction code uses the new models

7. **API Client Abstraction**: Improvements to the DbClient abstraction layer which:
   - Centralizes API interactions with the CoreDataStore API
   - Handles pagination and error handling for landmark data retrieval
   - Provides methods like `get_landmarks_page()` and `get_landmark_pdf_url()`
   - Now properly converts between dictionary and Pydantic model responses
   - Has enhanced type safety with proper error handling
   - Includes comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Recently Validated

1. **Pinecone Vector Validation Testing**:
   - Ran `tests/integration/test_pinecone_validation.py` to verify vector consistency
   - Confirmed the index has 16,146 vectors in total
   - Found inconsistent ID formats for landmark LP-00001 (`test-LP-00001-LP-00001-chunk-X` instead of the standard format)
   - Verified that 3 out of 4 tested landmarks have correct vector ID formats
   - Confirmed that all landmarks have consistent metadata despite ID format issues

2. **Type Safety Improvements**:
   - Verified that the DbClient implementation now passes mypy type checking
   - Confirmed that the type stubs for db_client.py correctly reflect the implementation
   - Tested the conversion logic between dict and Pydantic models with error handling

## In Progress

- **Type Safety Expansion**: Addressing mypy errors across the codebase, particularly in test files
- **Test Updates**: Updating integration tests to expect standardized ID formats
- **Wikipedia Article Processing**: Completing the GitHub Actions workflow integration
- **Combined Source Search**: Enhancing search capabilities to leverage both PDF and Wikipedia content
- **Chat API Enhancement**: Updating to utilize combined sources with proper attribution

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Vector ID Standardization**:
   - Run the `scripts/regenerate_pinecone_index.py` script with the `--verbose` flag to standardize all vector IDs
   - Focus on fixing LP-00001 vectors that use the incorrect `test-LP-00001-LP-00001-chunk-X` format
   - Verify results using the validation testing suite

2. **Testing Infrastructure Updates**:
   - Update `tests/integration/test_pinecone_validation.py` to remove special handling for LP-00001's non-standard format
   - Adjust all tests to expect standardized ID formats consistently
   - Run the full test suite to ensure compatibility with the standardized vectors

3. **Fix Remaining Type Safety Issues**:
   - Create additional type stubs for external dependencies where needed
   - Address the most critical mypy errors in test files
   - Update API interaction code to consistently use the new Pydantic models

4. **Complete Wikipedia Integration**:
   - Implement Wikipedia processing in the GitHub Actions workflow
   - Add verification steps to the CI/CD pipeline
   - Create dedicated integration tests for the Wikipedia pipeline

5. **Query API Enhancement**:
   - Extend the Query API to leverage both Wikipedia and PDF content
   - Add source attribution in search results
   - Use `landmark_query_testing.ipynb` to verify enhanced search functionality

6. **Chat API Extensions**:
   - Update to leverage content from both Wikipedia and PDF sources
   - Implement proper source attribution in responses
   - Add comprehensive testing with multiple content sources

## Known Issues

- Some older vectors have inconsistent ID formats (LP-00001 vectors use `test-LP-00001-LP-00001-chunk-X` format)
- Integration tests fail when expecting the standardized vector ID format for LP-00001
- Need to synchronize vector ID formats between production and test environments
- Several Pylance warnings about type annotations remain in the codebase despite mypy passing
- Some tests fail due to reliance on older model formats that lack required fields in the new models
