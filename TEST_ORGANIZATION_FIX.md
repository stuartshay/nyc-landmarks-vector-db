# Test Organization Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

GitHub Actions was failing during unit tests because some tests were making real external API calls and were incorrectly placed in the `tests/unit/` folder instead of `tests/integration/`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Moved Integration Tests to Correct Folder

**File Moved:** `tests/unit/test_chat_api.py` → `tests/integration/test_chat_api.py`

- This file contained tests marked with `@pytest.mark.integration`
- These tests make real API calls and should be in the integration folder

### 2. Fixed Wikipedia Processing Tests

**File:** `tests/unit/test_wikipedia_processing_fix.py`

- **Problem:** Tests were creating real `WikipediaProcessor()` instances that tried to connect to Pinecone
- **Fix:** Added proper mocking with `@patch` decorators for all external dependencies:
  - `@patch('nyc_landmarks.wikipedia.processor.PineconeDB')`
  - `@patch('nyc_landmarks.wikipedia.processor.EmbeddingGenerator')`
  - `@patch('nyc_landmarks.wikipedia.processor.WikipediaFetcher')`

## Configuration Already Correct

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and pytest configuration (`pytest.ini`) were already properly configured:

- Unit tests run with marker: `"not integration and not functional"`
- Integration tests are properly excluded from unit test runs
- Test markers are properly defined

## Verification

- ✅ Unit tests now pass without requiring external API keys
- ✅ Integration tests remain in the correct folder
- ✅ GitHub Actions should now pass for unit tests
- ✅ No changes needed to CI/CD configuration

## Result

The unit test suite is now properly isolated and will run successfully in CI/CD environments without requiring external API credentials or network access.
