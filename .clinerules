# Cline's Project Intelligence (.clinerules) for nyc-landmarks-vector-db

This file captures key patterns, preferences, and project intelligence learned during development.

## Core Workflow Rules

*   **Memory Bank Update Before Completion:** Always update relevant Memory Bank files (especially `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`) to reflect the completed work *before* using the `attempt_completion` tool. This ensures the Memory Bank is always synchronized with the project state before I conclude a task.

## Other Patterns/Notes
*   **Notebook Debugging:** Use `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute <notebook_path> --output <output_path>` to run notebooks from the terminal for collaborative debugging and output analysis. Review the generated output file.
(Add other learned patterns here as discovered)
