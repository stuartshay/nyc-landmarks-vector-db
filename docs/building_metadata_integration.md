# Building Metadata Integration

This document describes the implementation and improvements to the building metadata collection process in the NYC Landmarks Vector Database.

## Overview

The building metadata collection process retrieves building information associated with landmarks from the CoreDataStore API and integrates it into our metadata system. This information is important for:

1. Enriching landmark metadata
2. Supporting location-based queries
3. Providing detailed building information for landmark reports

## Implementation

The building metadata is collected through the `EnhancedMetadataCollector._add_building_data()` method, which:

1. Uses the DbClient's `get_landmark_buildings()` method to retrieve building data
2. Processes the data into a standardized format
3. Adds the building data to the landmark metadata dictionary

### Previous Implementation Issue

The previous implementation contained a redundant approach where:

1. A direct API call was made using the `requests` library to fetch building data
2. If that failed, it would fall back to using the DbClient's `get_landmark_buildings()` method

This redundancy was unnecessary because both methods ultimately call the same CoreDataStore API endpoint:
```
GET https://api.coredatastore.com/api/LpcReport/landmark/{limit}/1?LpcNumber={lp_id}
```

### Current Implementation

The implementation has been simplified to:
1. Only use the DbClient's `get_landmark_buildings()` method
2. Process the data consistently regardless of source format (dict or object)
3. Add all available fields to the building info dictionary

## Known Issues

While testing the implementation, we've identified a field mapping issue:

### Field Mapping Discrepancy

When comparing the direct API response with the EnhancedMetadataCollector output, some fields are not properly preserved:

**Direct API Response:**
```json
{
  "bbl": "1001210001",
  "binNumber": 1001394,
  "block": 121,
  "lot": 1,
  "latitude": 40.7129758114064,
  "longitude": -74.0036697784891
}
```

**Enhanced Metadata Output:**
```json
{
  "bbl": null,
  "binNumber": null,
  "block": null,
  "lot": null,
  "latitude": null,
  "longitude": null
}
```

This suggests that the field mapping in the DbClient's `_convert_item_to_lpc_report_model` method may not be preserving all fields when converting from the LandmarkDetail model to the LpcReportModel.

### Potential Solutions

1. Enhance the `_convert_item_to_lpc_report_model` method in DbClient to preserve all relevant fields
2. Consider returning LandmarkDetail objects directly rather than converting to LpcReportModel
3. Ensure consistent field naming between different model types to avoid data loss

## Future Improvements

1. Standardize the field naming conventions across all models
2. Add validation to ensure critical fields are properly preserved during model conversions
3. Consider adding more detailed building information to support richer queries
