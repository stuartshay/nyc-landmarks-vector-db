# PR #146 Documentation Fixes

## Issues Addressed

The GitHub Copilot PR review identified two documentation inconsistencies in `docs/pandas_2_3_0_upgrade.md`:

### Issue 1: pandas-stubs Version Mismatch

- **Problem**: Documentation stated pandas-stubs was "Kept at 2.2.3.250527" but setup.py had conflicting versions (>=2.2.3.250308 and >=2.1.1.0)
- **Fix**:
  - Removed duplicate pandas-stubs entry from setup.py (consolidated to >=2.2.3.250308)
  - Updated documentation to reflect "Using >=2.2.3.250308 (as specified in setup.py)"
  - Added clarification that requirements.txt pins to 2.2.3.250527 which satisfies setup.py requirement

### Issue 2: numpy Version Documentation Mismatch

- **Problem**: Documentation stated numpy>=1.26.0 requirement but setup.py actually requires numpy>=2.2.5
- **Fix**: Updated documentation to show "numpy>=1.26.0 ✓ (project requires: numpy>=2.2.5, current: 2.2.6)"

## Changes Made

### setup.py

- Removed duplicate `pandas-stubs>=2.1.1.0` entry
- Consolidated to single `pandas-stubs>=2.2.3.250308` specification

### docs/pandas_2_3_0_upgrade.md

- Fixed pandas-stubs version documentation
- Fixed numpy requirement documentation
- Added comprehensive "Project Dependency Specifications" section
- Clarified relationship between setup.py and requirements.txt versions
- Updated Impact Assessment section with correct pandas-stubs information

## Verification

- ✅ setup.py imports successfully (no syntax errors)
- ✅ Current environment has pandas 2.3.0, numpy 2.2.6
- ✅ pandas-stubs properly installed (2.2.3.250527 satisfies >=2.2.3.250308)
- ✅ Documentation now accurately reflects actual dependency specifications

## Result

The documentation now correctly reflects the actual dependency specifications in the codebase, resolving the low-confidence comments from the Copilot review.
