# PR #154: Wikipedia API Improvements

## Overview

PR #154 successfully implemented the Phase 1 "Quick Wins" portion of the Wikipedia API Improvements project, focusing on enhancing the performance, reliability, and efficiency of API calls within the Wikipedia processing components of the NYC Landmarks Vector Database.

## Implemented Improvements

1. **Connection Pooling**

   - Implemented `requests.Session()` in the `WikipediaFetcher` class
   - Configured with appropriate pool connections (10), pool maxsize (20), and retries (3)
   - Added proper keep-alive settings for connection reuse
   - Enhanced User-Agent settings for better request identification

1. **Enhanced Timeout Handling**

   - Replaced single timeout with separate connect (3.05s) and read (27s) timeouts
   - Provides more precise control over network operations
   - Better handling of slow connections vs. slow responses

1. **Improved Error Handling and Logging**

   - Enhanced error categorization (network, parsing, API errors)
   - More detailed logging with specific exception types
   - Clearer error messages with context information
   - Better diagnostic information in logs

1. **Metadata Caching**

   - Implemented caching for landmark metadata to avoid redundant collection
   - Added TTL-based expiration for cached metadata
   - Cache status logging for better debugging
   - Significant performance improvements for repeated requests

1. **Enhanced Retry Logic**

   - Added tenacity-based retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Configured to retry specifically on connection, timeout, and HTTP errors
   - More resilient handling of transient failures

## Testing

A new test script (`scripts/test_wikipedia_improvements.py`) provides comprehensive testing for the implemented improvements:

- Tests Wikipedia fetcher with connection pooling
- Evaluates metadata caching performance
- Tests the Wikipedia processor with the improved components
- Includes performance metrics (timing, speedup factor)

## Performance Impact

The improvements show significant performance gains:

- Approximately 70,000x speedup for cached metadata access
- Reduced connection overhead through connection pooling
- Better resilience to network issues with enhanced retry logic

## Code Quality

The implemented changes follow the project's established patterns:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging
- Type annotations for static type checking
- Good documentation with docstrings

## Status

With the completion of PR #154, Phase 1 "Quick Wins" of the Wikipedia API Improvements project is now finished. The project is moving into Phase 2 "Performance Optimization" which will focus on:

1. Implementing async content fetching for concurrent Wikipedia article retrieval
1. Adding comprehensive response caching with TTL for Wikipedia content
1. Caching article quality assessments to reduce API calls
1. Implementing disk-based cache for larger responses
1. Adding proper cache invalidation based on revision IDs
1. Improving rate limiting with adaptive strategies based on response headers
