## Changes Made

### Version Updates

- **pinecone**: `6.0.2` → `7.0.2`
- **pinecone-plugin-assistant**: `Not installed` → `1.6.1` (now bundled by default)
- **packaging**: `25.0` → `24.2` (downgraded due to Pinecone dependency requirements)

1. **Enhanced Inference API**: List and discover models from the model gallery
1. **Backup Support**: Create and restore backups for serverless indexes
1. **BYOC Support**: Bring Your Own Cloud - create and manage indexes in your cloud

### Performance Improvements

- **~70% faster client instantiation** due to lazy loading
- **Retries with exponential backoff** enabled by default for REST calls
- **PEP 561 compliance** with `py.typed` marker file for better type checking

## API Version Update

- Now using **2025-04 API version** (latest available)
- Previous version used **2025-01 API version**

## Code Compatibility

All existing code should continue to work without modifications. The SDK maintains backward compatibility while providing access to new features.

## New Methods Available

### Backup Operations

```python
from pinecone import Pinecone

pc = Pinecone()

# Create backup
backup = pc.create_backup(
    index_name="my-index", backup_name="my-backup", description="Backup description"
)

# List backups
backups = pc.list_backups()

# Create index from backup
pc.create_index_from_backup(name="restored-index", backup_id="backup-id")
```

### Enhanced Inference API

```python
# List available models
models = pc.inference.list_models()

# Get specific model details
model = pc.inference.get_model(model_name="pinecone-rerank-v0")
```

### BYOC Support

```python
from pinecone import ByocSpec

# Create BYOC index
pc.create_index(
    name="byoc-index",
    dimension=768,
    metric="cosine",
    spec=ByocSpec(environment="my-private-env"),
)
```

## Testing Results

✅ All imports successful
✅ PineconeDB class loads correctly
✅ New 7.x features are available
✅ Client initialization works as expected
✅ API key validation functioning properly

## Recommendations

1. **No immediate action required** - all existing code should continue working
1. **Consider using new features** like backups for production indexes
1. **Test thoroughly** in development environment before deploying to production
1. **Monitor performance** - should see faster startup times due to lazy loading
